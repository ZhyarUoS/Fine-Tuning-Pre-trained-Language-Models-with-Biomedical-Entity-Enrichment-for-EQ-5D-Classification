13,Comparing measurement properties of EQ-5D-Y-3L and EQ-5D-Y-5L in paediatric patients,Adolescent; Adult; Child; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; EQ-5D-Y-3L paediatric patients; EQ-5D-Y-5L; Health-related quality of life; Psychometrics,"BACKGROUND: The adult versions EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L have been extensive compared. This is not the case for the EQ-5D youth versions. The study aim was to compare the measurement properties and responsiveness of EQ-5D-Y-3L and EQ-5D-Y-5L in paediatric patients. METHODS: A sample of patients 8-16 years old with different diseases and a wide range of disease severity was asked to complete EQ-5D-Y-3L, EQ-5D-Y-5L, PedsQL Generic Core Scale, and selected, appropriate disease-specific instruments, three times. EQ-5D-Y-3L and EQ-5D-Y-5L were compared in terms of: feasibility, (re-)distribution properties, discriminatory power, convergent validity, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness. RESULTS: 286 participating patients suffered from one of the following diseases: major beta-thalassemia, haemophilia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute illness. Missing responses were comparable between versions of the EQ-5D-Y, suggesting comparable feasibility. The number of patients in the best health state (level profile 11111) was equal in both EQ-5D-Y versions. The projection of EQ-5D-Y-3L scores onto EQ-5D-Y-5L for all dimensions showed that the two additional levels in EQ-5D-Y-5L slightly improved the accuracy of patients in reporting their problems, especially if severe. Convergent validity with PedsQL and disease-specific measures showed that the two EQ-5D-Y versions performed about equally. Test-retest reliability (EQ-5D-Y-3L 0.78 vs EQ-5D-Y-5L 0.84), and sensitivity for detecting health changes, were both better in EQ-5D-Y-5L. CONCLUSIONS: Extending the number of levels did not give clear superiority to EQ-5D-Y-5L over EQ-5D-Y-3L based on the criteria assessed in this study. However, increasing the number of levels benefitted EQ-5D-Y performance in the measurement of moderate to severe problems and especially in longitudinal study designs",10.1186/s12955-021-01889-4,1
40,Feasibility of the EQ-5D in the elderly population: a systematic review of the literature,Aged; Feasibility Studies; Health Status; Humans; Psychometrics; Quality of Life/psychology; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; EQ-5D; EQ-5D-5L; Elderly; Feasibility; Health-related quality of life; Systematic review,"PURPOSE: The EQ-5D-3L and 5L are widely used generic preference-based instruments, which are psychometrically sound with the general population, but little is known about the instruments' feasibility in the elderly. Therefore, this systematic review summarises the available literature with regard to the feasibility properties of the instruments in the elderly population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, PsycInfo and EuroQol databases using pre-specified vocabulary and inclusion/exclusion criteria to identify publications until November 2020. Study characteristics and outcomes referring to the feasibility of the EQ-5D-3L and 5L in the elderly were extracted, if all study participants were at least 65+ years. RESULTS: We identified 17 studies reporting feasibility outcomes based on four criteria: missing values, completion rates, completion time and broad qualitative statements referring to the completion. Missing values per dimension ranged from 0 to 10.7%, although being mostly below 7%. The completion rate was around 90% or better, whereas the EQ VAS rating was missing from 2.3 to 25.3% of the respondents. Only two of the included studies examined the EQ-5D-5L; 15 studies reported on the EQ-5D-3L. CONCLUSION: Comparing our findings against the general population from published literature, we find that feasibility outcomes in older age groups are just below that of younger populations. Furthermore, older respondents have a higher propensity of requiring assistance or even an interviewer-based approach. Nonetheless, the reviewed literature indicates that the EQ-5D-3L still has good feasibility properties and, hence, is highly applicable in older respondents. However, further research is needed to explore feasibility properties of the EQ-5D-5L in this population",10.1007/s11136-021-03007-9,0
59,Comparing the self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of artisanal and small-scale gold miners and the urban population in Zimbabwe using the EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L+C) questionnaire: a cross-sectional study,Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gold; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mining; Quality of Life; Self Report/standards; Urban Population/statistics & numerical data; Young Adult; Zimbabwe/epidemiology; Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM); EuroQol (EQ-5D + C-3 L); Health-related quality of life (HRQoL); Mercury; Mercury intoxication; Minamata convention on mercury,"BACKGROUND: The role of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) as a source of income is rapidly gaining importance in the economically difficult times in Zimbabwe. Besides limited epidemiological data, no data about the self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of artisanal and small-scale gold miners exist. The aim of the project was to access HRQoL of ASGM workers to improve the data base and compare the data to the urban Zimbabwean population. METHODS: Data from 83 artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Kadoma, Zimbabwe was analysed The HRQoL was assessed using the EuroQol dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) accompanied by the cognition add-on questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L+C) and associated visual analogue scale (VAS). We described the EQ-5D dimensions and VAS values and computed health utility (HU) values using the Zimbabwean tariff. The proportions of miners reporting no problem in each EQ-5D dimension were compared with corresponding proportions reporting any problem (moderate or severe), and mean HU and VAS values were analysed across subgroups of the sample. To test differences between subgroups, Fisher's exact test was used and between urban and mining population, Student's t-test was used. RESULTS: The reported health states of miners were homogenous, with a large amount (42%) reporting 'full health'. Mean (SD) VAS and HU values were 81.0 (17.5) and 0.896 (0.13), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that miners with a lower education reported significantly more problems in the dimension of daily activities and miners with mercury contact had more problems in the dimensions of pain/discomfort and cognition. Comparison between mining and urban population showed that in the oldest age group, self-rated VAS values of miners were significantly higher than of their urban counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the HRQoL of mining and urban populations. However, the reason might be adverse health effects faced by the urban population that do not apply to rural mining areas. A higher education level of miners can improve the HRQoL, which is especially impaired by problems in the cognition dimension",10.1186/s12955-020-01475-0,1
85,Testing measurement properties of two EQ-5D youth versions and KIDSCREEN-10 in China,Adolescent; Child; China; Female; Health Status; Humans; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; China; EQ-5D-Y-3L; EQ-5D-Y-5L; Feasibility; KIDSCREEN-10; Validity; Youth,"OBJECTIVE: To assess measurement properties of the two youth versions of EQ-5D (i.e., 5-level EQ-5D-Y [Y-5L] and 3-level EQ-5D-Y [Y-3L]) and KIDSCREEN-10 in China. METHODS: Children and adolescents attending schools in Shanghai, China were recruited to self-complete the Y-5L, KIDSCREEN-10, and Y-3L questionnaires Their feasibility was assessed according to missing responses. Convergent validity of the EQ-5D-Y dimensions, a summated dimension score [SDS], and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were assessed by examining their correlations with the KIDSCREEN-10 index score and dimensions. Known-groups validity of SDS, VAS, and KIDSCREEN-10 index score were tested by comparing the scores of pupils with and without two conditions (i.e., overweight and shortsightedness), and the relative efficiency (RE) between them was also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 262 pupils (girl: 58.4%; mean age: 12.7 years) were enrolled. Missing responses were low for both the Y-5L (0.3%) and Y-3L (2.4%), and KIDSCREEN-10 (0.3%). The overall ceiling effects were 40.3% for the Y-5L, 44.1% for the Y-3L and 1.1% for the KIDSCREEN-10. The SDS(Y-5L), SDS(Y-3L) and VAS were moderately correlated with the KIDSCREEN-10 index score (|r|= 0.425 for SDS(Y-5L), 0.323 for SDS(Y-3L), and 0.435 for VAS; p < 0.01 for all). Similar EQ-5D-Y and KIDSCREEN-10 dimensions showed moderate to strong correlations (|r|> 0.3). Both the SDS(Y-5L) and SDS(Y-3L) had lower values, and VAS and KIDSCREEN-10 index score had higher values for pupils without shortsightedness compared with those for their counterparts. The difference was statistical significance for the SDS(Y-5L) and VAS (P < 0.05 for both), which also had higher RE in the condition. CONCLUSIONS: The Y-5L, Y-3L, and KIDSCREEN-10 questionnaires are feasible and valid for measuring HRQoL among children/adolescents in China. It also appears that the advantages of Y-5L over Y-3L were modest",10.1007/s10198-021-01307-y,1
377,Use of Antimalarial Agents is Associated with Favourable Physical Functioning in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,antimalarial agents; health perceptions; health-related quality of life; medication adherence; patient-reported outcomes; systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment,"Impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a major problem in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Antimalarial agents (AMA) are the cornerstone of SLE therapy, but data on their impact on HRQoL are scarce. We investigated this impact using baseline data from the BLISS-52 (NCT00424476) and BLISS-76 (NCT00410384) trials (n = 1684). HRQoL was self-reported using the Medical Outcomes Study short-form 36 (SF-36), functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue and 3-level EuroQoL 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaires. Patients on AMA (n = 1098/1684) performed better with regard to SF-36 physical component summary, physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, FACIT-Fatigue, EQ-5D utility index and EQ-5D visual analogue scale scores The difference in SF-36 physical functioning (mean ± standard deviation (SD): 61.1 ± 24.9 versus 55.0 ± 26.5; p < 0.001) exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (≥5.0). This association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounding factors in linear regression models (standardised coefficient, β = 0.07; p = 0.002). Greater proportions of AMA users than non-users reported no problems in the mobility, self-care, usual activities and anxiety/depression EQ-5D dimensions. AMA use was particularly associated with favourable HRQoL in physical aspects among patients with active mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal disease, and mental aspects among patients with active renal SLE These results provide support in motivating adherence to AMA therapy. Exploration of causality in the relationship between AMA use and favourable HRQoL in SLE has merit",10.3390/jcm9061813,1
460,Effect of angular correction during posterior instrumentation of spinal fractures on postoperative outcomes and quality of life,EuroQol EQ-5D; Thoracolumbar fracture; closed reduction; comi-score; quality of life,"BACKGROUND: Posterior instrumentation using pedicle screws and rods is the most commonly used technique for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures of the spine. The procedure aims to restore the neurologic and biomechanical functions of the spine and allows for early mobilization and rapid reintegration into society. It is unclear whether the magnitude of correction has an effect on postoperative outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether the magnitude of sagittal angular correction during posterior instrumentation of the spine had an effect on postoperative quality of life, pain and function outcomes as measured using the EQ5D-3L and the Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI) instruments. We also aimed to quantify the correlation between EQ5D-3L and COMI scores. METHODS: We analyzed the pre- and postoperative radiographs of 52 patients who underwent percutaneous pedicle screw placement for thoracolumbar fractures, as well as their self-reported EQ5D-3L and COMI quality of life, pain and functional outcome scores. Regression models were constructed to estimate the effect that the magnitude of Cobb angle correction had on postoperative outcomes. We also estimated the correlation between EQ5D-3L and COMI scores. RESULTS: The median EQ5D-3L TTO score was 0.9 (range, -0.1 to 1). The median COMI score was 3.1 (range, 0 to 10). There was no significant effect of the magnitude of correction on EQ5d-3L TTO scores (p= 0.3379; R= 0.36) or on COMI scores (p= 0.3379; R= 0.15). Age and bone mineral density were not found to be significant predictors of outcome (p= 0.05). There was a strong correlation between the EQ5D-3L TTO and COMI scores (r=-0.62). CONCLUSION: The magnitude of Cobb angle correction during pedicle screw instrumentation of thoracolumbar fractures did not influence quality of life, pain or function outcomes. There was good correlation between EQ5D-3L TTO scores and COMI scores",10.3233/THC-213616,1
1308,Relationship between residential district and health-related quality of life in Chungnam industrial complex area,Euro quality of life-5 dimension; Health-related quality of life; Industrial complex area; Republic of Korea,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between residential district of people, such as power plant, steel-mill and petrochemical industries, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, we randomly recruited participants for our study from industrial areas (thermoelectric power plant, steel-mill, petrochemical industry) and rural areas. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the relationships between Euro quality of life-5 dimension (EQ-5D) scores and living region, while controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In adjusted model, quality of life decreased with increasing category of age and were lower for females than males. EQ-5D scores of people living in the vicinity of thermoelectric power plant were significant lower than those of people living the vicinity of comparison region (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 2.53). CONCLUSIONS: Living region of thermoelectric power plant, was strongly associated with scores on the EQ-5D. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms which makes the relationship with the living regions and HRQoL",10.5620/eht.e2016017,1
1572,A Comparison of Concomitant Tributary Laser Ablation and Foam Sclerotherapy in Patients Undergoing Truncal Endovenous Laser Ablation for Lower Limb Varicose Veins,"Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Laser Therapy/methods; Leg/blood supply; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Prospective Studies; Saphenous Vein; Sclerotherapy/methods; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Varicose Veins/therapy","PURPOSE: To compare outcomes of patients who received simultaneous tributary endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) or foam sclerotherapy (FS) with EVLA of the great saphenous vein (GSV) trunk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study recruited 418 patients (542 legs) with diagnosed varicose veins. Patients in the EVLA/FS group (255 patients, 327 legs) received concomitant FS for the tributaries with truncal lasering. For the EVLA-alone group (163 patients, 215 legs), tributaries (8W) were ablated with EVLA in addition to the GSV trunk (14W). Complications, Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D), numerical rating scale (NRS) scores, and condition of residual varicosities were assessed at 3 days, 4 weeks, and 6 months after procedure. All residual varicosities were identified and treated with a staged FS at 6 months. RESULTS: Except for ecchymosis, incidence of other complications was not significantly different between both groups at 6 months Pain NRS scores of the EVLA/FS group were remarkably elevated at 4 weeks and then, at 6 months, declined to a level similar to the EVLA-alone group. The EVLA/FS group exhibited more significant improvement in both AVVQ and EQ-5D scales than the EVLA group at 6 months, while exhibiting poor improvement at 4 weeks. The EVLA/FS group had a significantly lower rate of residual varicosities than the EVLA group, thus reducing the need for the staged FS. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the feasibility and safety of simultaneous tributary EVLA and FS In addition, they indicate better early quality-of-life improvement and a reduced reoperation rate of simultaneously combined truncal EVLA and tributary FS",10.1016/j.jvir.2018.01.774,1
2027,The Scale of instantaneous wellbeing: validity in a population with major neurocognitive disorders,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/psychology; Female; Humans; Male; Neurocognitive Disorders/diagnosis/psychology; Neuropsychological Tests; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; major neurocognitive disorders; quality of life; scale","The quality of life (QoL) of people with a neurodegenerative pathology is a major issue in the absence of curative treatment. However, validated tools, suitable for patients with major neurocognitive disorders at a severe stage are rare and time-consuming in routine. The aim of this study is to analyze the validity of convergence and the reliability over time of a visual analog scale of well-being named EVIBE (Échelle d'évaluation instantanée de bien-être). The correlation between the EVIBE and another quality of life scale, the Qol-Ad was studied. The correlation with other scales expected to vary with QoL was also studied with the EQ-5D for the measurement of the state of health felt and the NPI-ES for the measurement of behavioral disorders. The EVIBE was administered twice, a few minutes apart, to measure its reliability over time. One hundred and thirty-five patients with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder were recruited. The results indicated a significant correlation with Qol-AD (r=0.54, p< 0.001). The correlation remained significant when the Mini mental state examination was less than 10 (r=0.39, p=0.05). Correlations between EVIBE and EQ-5D and NPI-ES indicated more mixed results with significant correlation only for the analog part of the EQ-5D (r=0.34, p=0.007). The comparison between the two EVIBEs a few minutes apart showed a satisfactory agreement (r=0.52, p> 0.001). This study shows that EVIBE present a good convergence validity and a good reliability over time to measure the QoL of patients with neurodegenerative pathology even at severe stages of the disease. The scale allows a direct and rapid assessment of the QoL of patients in routine",10.1684/pnv.2018.0745,0
2054,Using the Choice Sequence in Time Trade-Off as Discrete Choices: Do the Two Stories Match?,Choice Behavior; Health Status; Humans; Logistic Models; Patient Preference; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; DCE; EQ-5D; TTO; health state utitlity; methodological study; regression modelling,"OBJECTIVES: The EQ-5D-5L valuation protocol recommends combining time trade-off (TTO) and discrete choice experiments (DCEs). DCEs that include a duration attribute (DCE(TTO)) allow modeling on the quality-adjusted life-year scale Because the choice sequence in a TTO can be construed as a series of DCE(TTO), we used data from a single TTO study to investigate the extent to which DCE values match TTO values when based on identical preferences. METHODS: In a TTO design in which a fixed set of choices were administered without termination at preference indifference, 202 individuals each valued 10 EQ-5D health states. From identified indifference points, we estimated three sets of TTO values: (i) plotting means and (ii) applying censored regressions at -1 and 1. Using all strict preferences, we (iii) estimated DCE(TTO) values with a logit model and a bootstrap procedure RESULTS: Estimated DCE(TTO) and TTO values agreed well at the severe end of the quality-adjusted life-year scale, but with decreasing severity, DCE(TTO) values were higher than TTO-values, with the difference peaking at 0.37 for the mildest health state. Left-censoring TTO values at -1 worsen the agreement for the worst health states and did not affect health states. Right censoring at 1 improved the agreement for mild states. CONCLUSIONS: TTO and the DCE(TTO) values estimated from the same preference data diverged, with increasing difference for milder health states. Although the values converged when applying censored regression at +1, we question the validity of this adjustment",10.1016/j.jval.2019.10.003,0
2324,Ferric Carboxymaltose Improves the Quality of Life of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Iron Deficiency without Anaemia,ferric carboxymaltose; health-related quality of life; inflammatory bowel disease; iron deficiency,"BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) without anaemia is a common comorbidity associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that has a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). METHODS: This multicentre, prospective, observational study examined the response to, safety of and impact on HRQoL of a single 500 mg dose of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with IBD and ID without anaemia. The diagnostic criteria for ID were low serum ferritin (&lt;30 µg/L in the absence of inflammatory activity or &lt;100 µg/L with inflammation) and transferrin saturation index (TSAT) &lt; 16%. The effect on iron levels and HRQoL, according to the health status questionnaires SF-12v2 and EQ-5D, was evaluated 1 month after FCM infusion in an outpatient setting RESULTS: Of the 105 patients who received FCM, 98 patients completed the study After 1 month, a single dose of FCM significantly increased serum ferritin, serum iron and TSAT. Importantly, patients reported fewer ID symptoms and problems on all EQ-5D dimensions. They also had higher EQ-5D visual analogue scale and SF-12v2 scores after treatment. FCM had similar clinical effects on men and women and on patients with Crohn's disease (n = 66) and ulcerative colitis (n = 32) CONCLUSION: A single dose of FCM rapidly restored iron parameters and significantly improved patients' symptoms and HRQoL at 1 month after treatment",10.3390/jcm11102786,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of European countries. Patients were recruited through patients' associations. Data on their resource use and absence from the labour market were retrospectively obtained from an online questionnaire. Costs were estimated by a bottom-up approach and the EuroQol-5 Domain (EQ-5D) questionnaire was used to measure patients' and caregivers' HRQOL. RESULTS: Five countries were included in the analysis. The mean annual cost of FXS per patient varied from €4951 in Hungary to €58,862 in Sweden. Direct non-healthcare costs represented the majority of costs in all countries but there were differences in the share incurred by formal and informal care among those costs. Costs were also shown to differ between children and adults. Mean EQ-5D utility score for adult patients varied from 0.52 in France (n = 42) to 0.73 in Hungary (n = 2), while for caregivers this score was consistently inferior to 0.87. CONCLUSION: Our findings underline that, although its prevalence is low, FXS is costly from a societal perspective. They support the development of tailored policies to reduce the consequences of FXS on both patients and their relatives",10.1007/s10198-016-0784-3,1
2431,Agreement Among Paper and Electronic Modes of the EQ-5D-5L,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Computers, Handheld/standards; Cross-Over Studies; Data Collection/methods/standards; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires/standards; Telephone/standards; Young Adult","INTRODUCTION: While the EQ-5D-5L has been migrated to several electronic modes, evidence supporting the measurement equivalence of the original paper-based instrument to the electronic modes is limited. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to comprehensively examine the equivalence of the paper and electronic modes (i.e., handheld, tablet, interactive voice response [IVR], and web) METHODS: As part of the foundational work for this study, the test-retest reliability of the paper-based, UK English format of the EQ-5D-5L was assessed using a single-group, single-visit, two-period, repeated-measures design. To compare paper and electronic modes, three independent samples were recruited into a three-period crossover study. Each participant was assigned to one of six groups to account for order effects. Descriptive statistics, mean differences (i.e., split-plot analysis of variance [ANOVA]), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. RESULTS: The test-retest results showed mean differences near zero and ICC values > 0.90 for both the index and the EQ VAS scores. For the electronic comparisons, mean difference confidence intervals (CIs) for the EQ-5D index scores and EQ VAS scores reflected equivalence of the means across all modes, as the CIs were wholly contained inside the equivalence interval. Further, the ICC 95% lower CIs for the index and EQ VAS scores showed values above the thresholds for denoting equivalence across all comparisons in each sample. No significant mode-by-order interactions were present in any ANOVA model. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our comparisons of the paper, screen-based, and phone-based formats of the EQ-5D-5L provided substantial evidence to support the measurement equivalence of these modes of data collection",10.1007/s40271-020-00419-6,1

METHOD: Prospective and descriptive study developed from January 2015 to January 2016 in Campo Arañuelo Hospital (Navalmoral de la Mata, Cáceres, Spain). Sociodemographic variables, functional capacity (Barthel Index), dependence (Lawton and Brody Scale), quality of life related to health (Questionnaire Euroqol-5D) and on mood (Yesavage geriatric depression scale GDS15) were collected, prior to the hip fracture and one month after the intervention. RESULTS: Significant decrease in functional capacity (Barthel), the mean score was 86.66 before the fracture, compared to 58.72 at the month after surgery (P<.001). Regarding the Lawton and Brody Scale, the mean was 4.95 and at 2.24months (P<.001). The mean scores on health related quality of life, baseline and post-intervention in the analog visual scale of the EQ-5D questionnaire were 72.95 vs 59.45 respectively (P=.004). Although before the fracture, 94.10% had no alteration in mood, one month after the intervention there was a possible depression of 20.50% and an established depression of 11%. CONCLUSIONS: The fracture of the head affects the functionality of the elderly, causing dependence for the basic and instrumental activities of daily life. It also affects the quality of life related to health and this decreases significantly in the month after surgery. Depressive mood is inversely related to perceived perceived quality of life",10.1016/j.enfcli.2019.03.003,0
2901,Quality of Life Experienced by Major Lower Extremity Amputees,major lower limb amputation; prosthesis; quality of life; trans-femoral amputation; trans-tibial amputation,"Lower extremity amputations and diabetic foot-related complications in the Caribbean population have been previously reported. However, there is a lack of evidence that assess the quality of life experienced in such amputees. This study aimed to determine the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients after a major lower limb amputation. Data collection was performed for all major lower limb amputations undertaken at a tertiary care institution in Trinidad and Tobago, between January 2012 to December 2016. The quality of life for patients who were accessible, alive, and willing to participate was assessed using the EuroQol 5D-5L tool. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests comparing medians across various subgroups. A total of 134 individuals were still alive and willing to participate in the study. The average EQ-5D-5L index value for the cohort was (0.598), which was significantly lower compared to EQ-5D-5L population norms for Trinidad and Tobago p < 0.05 Statistically significant differences were also seen in median EQ-5D-5L index value for patients who ambulated with a prosthesis (0.787) compared to those who used another device for mobilization (0.656), p < 0.05, and to those patients who did not ambulate (0.195), p < 0.05. A comparable Quality of life was seen between the level of amputation (transtibial versus transfemoral) and gender (males versus females), p-values were 0.21 and 1.0, respectively. Overall quality of life after major amputation, as well as independent mobilization with a prosthesis, continues to be problematic in the Caribbean population. Factors adversely related to the quality of life post major amputation include increasing age, problems related to mobility, and non-ambulatory patients",10.7759/cureus.17440,1

Although social support has been shown to be a protective factor for improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and depression and anxiety have been identified as two major causes of psychological distress among people living with HIV, it is still unclear how social support, anxiety, and depression interact to influence HRQoL. The objective of our study was to demonstrate the nature of predictors, direct effects and mediator effects among social support, anxiety, depression symptoms and HRQoL in pregnant women living with HIV. We investigated a total of 101 pregnant women living with HIV in Yunnan province in China from April 2016 to June 2016. All participants completed the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), the Chinese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS) and Quality of Life instruments (EuroQoL Five Dimensions Questionnaire, EQ-5D). The relationships between the variables were examined by Pearson's or Spearman's correlation analysis. Predictor effects were tested using separate multiple regressions, controlling for demographic variables and HIV diagnosis variables. Direct and mediation effects of social support on HRQoL were tested using a structural equation model (SEM). Anxiety and depression symptoms were negatively correlated with subjective social support, support utilization, social support and HRQoL. Social support significantly predicted better HRQoL, and anxiety and depression symptoms significantly predicted poorer HRQoL. Anxiety and depression symptoms partially mediated the associations between social support and HRQoL. Anxiety and depression symptoms completely mediated the associations of objective support and support utilization with HRQoL. Interventions to improve HRQoL in pregnant women living with HIV must consider the mediation effect of anxiety and depression symptoms on the association between social support and HRQoL. Social support interventions are valid only when anxiety and depression symptoms are managed effectively",10.1080/09540121.2018.1456640,1
3049,Asthma insights from Jordan: cross-sectional observational study,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asthma/prevention & control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Jordan; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; ACT; Asthma control; Jordan; low-income countries; quality of life","OBJECTIVE: The burden of uncontrolled asthma on patients in Jordan is largely unknown. This study assessed different aspects of asthma clinical features: the level of asthma control, its correlation with quality of life, and possible predictors of asthma control. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews with asthmatic patients (≥16 years old) in north Jordan from 2013 to 2014 were conducted Outcomes measures were assessed using the asthma control test (ACT), the mini asthma quality of life questionnaire (mini-AQLQ), and the Generic health-related quality of life (EQ-5D). The relationship between asthma control and quality of life was examined using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Predictors of asthma control were determined using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 255 patients were recruited (mean age 45.16 years, 74.5% female). Approximately one-third of subjects (30.6%; n = 78) had controlled asthma (ACT ≥ 20). A strong correlation between asthma control and both mini-AQLQ and EQ-5D scores was identified (p < 0.001). Subjects who required to step-up treatment (OR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02-0.63, p = 0.01) and with acute asthma exacerbation (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.18-0.58, p < 0.001) were independently associated with poor asthma control. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the recruited patients have not achieved optimal asthma control and was associated with low quality of life. The study highlights that even in low-income countries, a simple assessment tool such as the ACT can be utilized to screen and categorize asthma control This approach would facilitate a better treatment plan and eventually improve asthma control and quality of life in asthma patients",10.3109/02770903.2015.1121493,1

This study aimed to calculate the minimal important change (MIC) thresholds for the EQ VAS for improvement and deterioration after surgery for disk herniation or spinal stenosis. METHODS: Patients, who were surgically treated for disk herniation or spinal stenosis between 2007 and 2016, were recruited from the Swedish spine register Preoperative and 1-year postoperative data for a total of 25772 procedures were available for analysis. We used two anchor-based methods to estimate MIC for EQ VAS: (1) a predictive model based on logistic regression and (2) receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The SF-36 health transition item was used as anchor. RESULTS: The EQ VAS MIC threshold for improvement after disk herniation surgery ranged from 8.25 to 11.8 while the corresponding value for deterioration ranged from - 6.17 to 0.5. For spinal stenosis surgery the corresponding MIC values ranged from 10.5 to 14.5 and - 7.16 to - 6.5 respectively. There were moderate negative correlations (disk herniation - 0.47, spinal stenosis - 0.46) between the 1 year change in the EQ VAS and the SF-36 health transition item (MIC anchor). CONCLUSIONS: For EQ VAS, we recommend a MIC threshold of 12 points for improvement after surgery for disk herniation or spinal stenosis, whereas the corresponding threshold for deterioration is - 7 points. There are marked differences between the EQ VAS MIC for improvement and deterioration after surgery for disk herniation or spinal stenosis. The MIC value varied depending on the method used for MIC estimation",10.1007/s11136-022-03182-3,0

METHODS: As part of the prospective observational study entitled ""Access to Transplantation and Transplant Outcome Measures,"" we captured information on patient characteristics and treatment factors in a cohort of incident kidney transplant recipients and a cohort of prevalent patients on the transplant waiting list in the United Kingdom. We assessed patients' health status using the EQ-5D-5L and conducted multivariable regression analyses of index scores. RESULTS: EQ-5D-5L responses were available for 512 transplant recipients and 1704 waiting-list patients. Mean index scores were higher in transplant recipients at 6 months after transplant surgery (0.83) compared with patients on the waiting list (0.77). In combined regression analyses, a primary renal diagnosis of diabetes was associated with the largest decrement in utility scores. When separate regression models were fitted to each cohort, female gender and Asian ethnicity were associated with lower utility scores among waiting-list patients but not among transplant recipients. Among waiting-list patients, longer time spent on dialysis was also associated with poorer utility scores. When comorbidities were included, the presence of mental illness resulted in a utility decrement of 0.12 in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into variations in health-state utility values from a single source that can be used to inform cost-effectiveness evaluations in patients with end-stage renal disease",10.1016/j.jval.2017.01.011,1
3256,Efficacy of acetaminophen with and without oxycodone for analgesia in non-operative treatment of extremity fractures in adults: protocol for a double-blind randomized clinical trial,"Acetaminophen/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Double-Blind Method; Drug Combinations; Extremities/injuries; Female; Fractures, Bone/physiopathology/therapy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Oxycodone/therapeutic use; Pain Management/methods; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult; Acetaminophen; Fracture; Non-operative treatment; Opioids","BACKGROUND: Opioids and acetaminophen are both widely used to relieve pain after non-operative treatment of limb fractures, but evidence for the superiority of opioids versus acetaminophen is lacking. In this study, we aim to determine whether acetaminophen is non-inferior to the acetaminophen/oxycodone combination for pain relief after non-operative fixation of an extremity limb fracture. We hypothesize that acetaminophen is non-inferior to the acetaminophen/oxycodone combination. METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Power analysis determined that 1226 participants will be needed (P <0.05, power 90%). Patients with acute limb fracture who receive non-operative treatment will be recruited and randomly allocated into two groups: the intervention group will receive oral oxycodone (10 mg) and acetaminophen (650 mg), and the control group will receive acetaminophen (650 mg) only. All participants will be instructed to take one pill of study medication on an as-needed basis and no more frequently than once every 8 h. The primary outcome measure will be scores on the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) over 14 days. Secondary outcome measures are scores on the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D), self-rated satisfaction with the analgesia produced, self-reported nighttime sleep duration, number of intervention or control pills used, and total duration for taking intervention or control medication. Change of pain scores and the number of times that analgesic drugs were taken in the two groups will be statistically evaluated with Student t tests according to their fracture site DISCUSSION: This study will be a randomized controlled trial that is adequately powered to test the hypothesis that acetaminophen is non-inferior to the combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone in relieving objectively measured pain after non-operative treatment of limb fractures in adults. It will hopefully provide a safe and effective analgesic plan for such patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR registry: ChiCTR1800017015 . Registered on July 8, 2018",10.1186/s13063-019-3579-x,0
3382,Patient-Reported Outcome in Two Chronic Diseases: A Comparison of Quality of Life and Response Profiles in Severe Migraine and Severe Asthma,asthma; migraine; psychological distress; quality of life; work performance,"INTRODUCTION: Migraine and asthma are two frequent, disabling, chronic disorders with a major impact on patient well-being. The objectives of this study were to compare subjective well-being between patients with severe forms of migraine or asthma using a panel of PROs. METHODS: Adult patients were recruited during routine consultations with chest physicians or neurologists. Patients with severe migraine (reporting headaches on ≥8 days/month and having failed ≥2 prophylactic treatments) and patients with severe asthma (according to the 2017 GINA definition: requiring Step 4 or 5 treatment or presenting uncontrolled symptoms) were eligible. Each patient completed the EuroQol Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD). Patients with severe migraine the 6-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and those with severe asthma completed the Asthma Control Test (ACT). RESULTS: 249 patients with severe migraine and 96 with severe asthma were enrolled. Mean EQ-5D-5L utility scores were significantly higher in the severe migraine group than in the severe asthma group (0.75±0.25 vs 0.68±0.26; p<0.01). Low EQ-5D-5L utility scores were associated with frequent (≥15 headache days/month) or disabling (HIT-6 score ≥60) headaches and with poor asthma control. Patients with severe migraine more frequently presented a HAD depression score ≥11 (23.0% in severe migraine; 7.5% in severe asthma; p<0.01), whereas those with severe asthma more frequently reported problems with mobility, self-care and usual activities. Absenteeism (percent worktime missed) was similar in both groups (severe migraine: 9.0%±19.1%; severe asthma: 13.8%±22.9%) but work impairment was higher in the severe migraine group (44.3% vs 28.4%; p<0.01) CONCLUSION: Quality of life, work activity and psychological distress are all deteriorated in both severe migraine and severe asthma. Different aspects are affected in the two diseases: a greater impact on psychological aspects in severe migraine and a greater impact on physical aspects in severe asthma",10.2147/PROM.S222597,1
3484,The relationship between medical comorbidities and health-related quality of life among adults with type 2 diabetes: The experience of different hospitals in southern Bangladesh,"Adult; Bangladesh/epidemiology; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/epidemiology; Hospitals; Humans; Pain/epidemiology; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires","OBJECTIVE: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a critical determinant to assess the severity of chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus. It has a close association with complications, comorbidities, and medical aid. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of medical comorbidities and determine the relationship between comorbidities and HRQoL among type 2 diabetic patients of southern Bangladesh. METHOD: This study was a cross-sectional study conducted through face to face interviews using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and by reviewing patient's health records with prior written consent. The study was conducted on 2,136 patients with type 2 diabetes attending five hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh, during the tenure of November 2018 to July 2019. Quality of life was measured using the widely-used index of EQ-5D that considers 243 different health states and uses a scale in which 0 indicates a health state equivalent to death and 1 indicates perfect health status. The five dimensions of the quality index included mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. RESULTS: Patients with three comorbidities and with four or more comorbidities had a higher probability of reporting ""extreme problem"" or ""some problem"" in all five dimensions of the EQ-5D index compared with those without comorbidity (Odds ratio: mobility, 3.99 [2.72-5.87], 6.22 [3.80-10.19]; usual activity, 2.67 [1.76-4.06], 5.43 [3.28-8.98]; self-care, 2.60 [1.65-4.10], 3.95 [2.33-6.69]; pain or discomfort, 2.22 [1.48-3.33], 3.44 [1.83-6.45]; anxiety or depression, 1.75 [1.07-2.88], 2.45 [1.19-5.04]). The number of comorbidities had a negative impact on quality of life. CONCLUSION: Prevalent comorbidities were found to be the significant underlying cause of declined HRQoL. To raise diabetes awareness and for better disease management, the exposition of comorbidities in regards to HRQoL of people with diabetes should be considered for type 2 diabetes management schemas",10.1371/journal.pone.0267713,1
3503,Health-Related Quality of Life and Costs of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Adolescents and Young Adults in Germany,adolescents; cost-of-illness; economic burden; posttraumatic stress disorder; quality of life,"BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the psychopathological consequences of sexual and/or physical abuse. The economic burden is assumed to be high, whereas health-related quality of life and education is negatively affected. This study aims to determine health care costs, health-related quality of life, and educational interruption in adolescents and young adults with PTSD after sexual and/or physical abuse in Germany. METHODS: This analysis used data of 87 participants aged 14-21 years of a randomized controlled trial. Health care utilization, health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), sick leave days, productivity, and delay or failure to achieve educational aims were assessed Health care costs from a payer perspective were calculated using unit costs for the year 2014. RESULTS: Mean health care costs for a six-month period were 5,243€ (SE 868€). In particular, costs of inpatient stays in psychiatric hospitals, general hospitals and rehabilitation as well as child welfare institutions were high. In addition, health-related quality of life was lower due to anxiety/depression, resulting in a mean EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS score of 0.70 and 61.0, respectively. Furthermore, participants reported on average 27 sick leave days, a productivity loss of 61%, and a delay in education attainment as well as having been unable to achieve educational aims. CONCLUSION: PTSD in adolescents and young adults is associated with a high economic burden. Health-related quality of life was substantially reduced. Furthermore, delay and productivity losses in education were observed.

The objective was to identify health economic evaluations of psoriasis treatments that have been published to date. Of particular interest were the mostly used analysis and outcome parameters, the compared treatments, and the question, if available health economic studies may be used to perform a meta-analysis of qualitative findings. A systematic literature search using PubMed Medline, Ovid Medline, and Cochrane Library was performed for articles, published and available until mid of January 2016. Among the key words were the terms ""psoriasis"" and ""cost-effectiveness"". The search resulted in 318 articles without duplicates. Thereof 60 health economic analyses in psoriasis management were identified. Most of these are cost-effectiveness evaluations (45). The clinical parameter PASI (Psoriasis Area Severity Index) is the most often used cost-effectiveness outcome (33) followed by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) (6). In case of cost-utility analyses, QALYs (quality-adjusted life-years) were mostly generated with the help of EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) (12), which was partly based on PASI and DLQI values. The majority of health economic studies is focusing on the direct medical and non-medical costs without consideration of productivity losses. Almost 70 % of 60 publications were conducted in Europe. Overall, most considered systemic treatments were the biological agents etanercept (36), adalimumab (27), and infliximab (26) followed by ustekinumab (17) and phototherapy (incl. UV-B, PUVA/psoralen combined with UV-A) (14). Comparisons including only topical treatments mostly focused on vitamin D treatment (14), corticosteroids (13), and coal tar products (6) followed by dithranol (5) and tazarotene (4). Given the setting, compared treatments, and study conditions, different results can be found for medical decision-making. Thereby, it can be noted that there are no standards on methods and outcomes measures available. This leads to a very limited comparability of health economic studies and presents no comfortable basis to examine a meta-analysis of health economic results. The presented systematic review shows the need for nationwide data and interpretation",10.1007/s00403-016-1673-4,0

QOL was measured using the EQ-5D-3L, and activity limitations were analyzed alongside predisposing factors (gender, age, education level, and marital status), enabling factors (basic living security, health insurance type, private insurance status, household income, and living with family), need factors (number of chronic diseases, subjective health status, and unmet medical needs), and health behaviors (smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and health screening). Data were analyzed using homogeneity testing, t tests, and logistic and multiple regression. RESULTS: The mean EQ-5D index was 0.8 with activity limitations and 0.9 without activity limitations. In mobility domain, patients without activity limitations showed significant effects of age, education level, number of chronic diseases, subjective health status, and unmet medical needs on mobility, whereas patients with activity limitations only showed a significant effect of age. In self-care domain, age, household income, and number of chronic diseases showed significant factors on patients without activity limitations, but there was no significant factor associated with activity limitations. Among the factors affecting usual activities, gender was found to have a significant effect only on patients with activity limitations, and subjective health status was found to have a significant effect regardless of activity limitations. Among the factors affecting pain/discomfort, living with family only affected pain/discomfort in patients with activity limitations. Among the factors affecting anxiety/depression, gender and alcohol consumption had significant effects only on patients with activity limitations. CONCLUSION: Factors affecting the QOL of injured patients differed depending on whether patients had activity limitations. Therefore, when assessing injured patients, it may be necessary to ascertain the extent of activity limitations, and medical institutions and local communities need when implementing education and interventions to improve their QOL",10.1007/s11136-020-02708-x,1

Through a comprehensive review of available studies, we aimed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people living with IPF and the instruments used in this assessment.Searches were conducted up to May, 2020. Quality appraisal and data extraction were performed using pre-designed forms. Narrative synthesis approach was used to report results of the systematic review and a random effects model was used for the meta-analysis. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed, and a trim and fill method was used to assess publication bias.The review included 134 studies. The most used instruments to measure HRQoL were St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Short Form 36 (SF36) and EuroQoL (EQ5D). Standardised mean scores (95% confidence interval) for these instruments were as follows: SGRQ total score: 44.72 (42.21-47.22); SF36 physical component score (PCS): 37.00 (34.74-39.26) SF36 mental component score (MCS): 50.18 (48.41-51.95); King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire total score: 58.38 (55.26-61.51); and EQ5D utility: 0.73 (0.68-0.79). Analysis of standardised means for both SGRQ and SF36 demonstrated worse scores in physical health domains as compared to mental health domains.This systematic review confirms that IPF negatively affected HRQoL, mostly impacting the physical health domains. This study also demonstrated that a diverse number of instruments are used to evaluate HRQoL. In view of this diversity, a standardised approach to measurement of HRQoL for IPF is important to ensure that comparisons made are reliable",10.1183/16000617.0154-2020,1

A cross-sectional study was conducted on older adults (≥60 years old) residing in Soc Son district, northern Vietnam Non-frailty, pre-frailty, and frailty conditions were evaluated using Fried's frailty criteria. The EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels(EQ-5D-5L) instrument was employed to measure HRQOL. Socioeconomic, behavioral, health status, and healthcare utilization characteristics were collected as covariates. Among 523 older adults, 65.6% were pre-frail, and 21.7% were frail. The mean EQ-5D-5L indexes of the non-frailty, pre-frailty, and frailty groups were 0.70 (SD = 0.18), 0.70 (SD = 0.19), and 0.58 (SD = 0.20), respectively. The differences were found between non-frailty and frailty groups (p < 0.01), as well as the pre-frailty and frailty groups (p<0.01). After adjusting for covariates, the estimated mean difference in the HRQOL between the non-frailty and frailty groups was -0.10 (95%CI= -0.17; -0.02) (R(2) = 45.2%), showing a 10% reduction of the maximum EQ-5D-5L index.This study emphasized the high prevalence of frailty among older adults in the rural communities of Vietnam.

Factors and outcomes associated with infection recurrence for hip PJI are limited. The primary aim of this study was to determine factors associated with infection recurrence after two-stage exchange. Secondary aims were survival, mobility, and the EuroQol five-dimension scale (EQ-5D-5L) health state. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated patients with two-stage exchange for hip PJI at our institution from 2006 to 2017. Follow-up was conducted for a minimum of four years after the reimplantation. RESULTS: We included 135 patients with 139 hip PJIs. The mean age of the patients was 69.6 years (range 32-88). The infection recurrence rate was 14.4% (n = 20) after a mean follow-up of 8.0 years (range 4.0-13.1). Four factors for recurrence were identified at the time of the first stage: previous orthopaedic diagnoses (p < 0.001), type of explanted prosthesis (p = 0.004), cultured microorganisms (p = 0.033), and sinus tract (p = 0.035). A longer surgical reimplantation time (p = 0.015) was the only one factor found at the second stage. The estimated Kaplan-Meier survival for the total sample was 9.0 years (95% confidence interval 8.3-9.8), without significant difference for those with infection recurrence compared to recurrence-free patients (log-rank 0.931). At the time of follow-up, 89 patients were alive. For these patients, Parker mobility score (p = 0.102), EuroQol five-dimensional scale (p = 0.099), and EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) (p = 0.027) were inferior in those with infection recurrence, but significance was found only for VAS CONCLUSION: In this study with mid- to long-term follow-up, five factors for infection recurrence were identified. Recurrence did not affect survival, but health-related quality of life was inferior compared to recurrence-free patients The results suggest that the period of the first stage including previous orthopaedic diagnoses requires more consideration in the future",10.1007/s00264-022-05333-0,0

In order to reflect value, PROMs should measure outcomes that matter to patients. However, patients are not always involved in the development of PROMs. This study therefore aimed to investigate whether PROMs, which were developed without patient involvement, are relevant to patients and whether the level of importance allocated towards aspects of these PROMs varies between patient groups. METHODS: All patients from 20 Dutch hospitals undergoing hip or knee surgery in 2014 were invited to a PROMs survey Participants were asked to rate the importance of each of the items in the HOOS-Physical Function Short form or the KOOS-Physical Function Short form, the EQ-5D and the NRS pain. RESULTS: Most outcomes were considered important However, 77.7% of hip surgery patients rated being able to run as unimportant Being able to kneel (32.7%) or squat (39.6%) was not important to a considerable minority of knee surgery patients. Pain, especially during rest, was considered very important by both hip (68.2%) and knee (66.5%) surgery patients. Patients who were older, male, experienced overall bad health and psychological health considered many items from the PROMs less important than other patients DISCUSSION: Patients differ in what they consider important. Health-care professionals should explore patients' preferences and discuss which treatment options best fit patients' preferences. Additionally, if PROMs are used in performance measurement, further research is needed to look at whether and how variation in patient preferences can be taken into account",10.1111/hex.12573,1

This study is aimed to investigate the effect of metformin on handgrip strength, gait speed, myostatin serum level, and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) among non-diabetic pre-frail elderly patients. METHODS: a double blind randomized controlled trial study was conducted on non-diabetic elderly outpatients aged ≥ 60 years with pre-frail status based on phenotype and/ or index criteria (Cardiovascular Health Study and/ or Frailty Index 40 items) consecutively recruited from March 2015 to June 2016 at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. One-hundred-twenty subjects who met the research criteria were randomized and equally assigned into 3 x 500 mg metformin or placebo group The study outcomes were measured at baseline and after 16 weeks of intervention RESULTS: out of 120 subjects, 43 subjects in metformin group and 48 subjects in placebo group who completed the intervention. There was a significant improvement on the mean gait speed of metformin group by 0.39 (0.77) second or 0.13 (0.24) meter/second that remained significant after adjusting for important prognostic factors (p = 0.024). There was no significant difference on handgrip strength, myostatin serum level, and HR-QoL between both groups. CONCLUSION: 3 x 500 mg metformin for 16 weeks was statistically significant and clinically important in improving usual gait speed as one of the HR-QoL dimensions, but did not significantly improve the EQ-5D index score, handgrip strength, nor myostatin serum level",na,1

We aimed to find a disease-specific questionnaire for routine application in large cohorts and to assess its additional explanatory power to generic HRQL tool (EQ-5D-5L). Methods: 1,350 participants of the disease management program COPD received the EQ-5D-5L combined with one of the three disease-specific tools: COPD Assessment Test (CAT), Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) or St. George's Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (SGRQ) (450 participants each). We compared metric properties and evaluated the Germany-specific experience-based values (EBVS) and utilities in comparison to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). We calculated the additional explanatory power of the identified disease-specific tool on VAS through regression analysis. Results: 344 patients returned the questionnaire. CAT, CCQ, and SGRQ group did not differ regarding baseline characteristics. The questionnaire specific response rates were 33.7% for CAT, 30.5% for CCQ, and 34.6% SGRQ, thereof 94.0%, 94.3%, and 65.6% valid answers, respectively. EBVS was better suited to reflect VAS than utilities. CAT increased the explanatory power by 10%. Conclusion: CAT outperformed CCQ and SGRQ, and it increased the explanatory power of VAS. EBV combined with CAT seems superior to only generic or disease-specific approaches",10.1080/14737167.2019.1662302,1

Before the era of novel agents, the incidence was 10%-14%. Causes of death included infections/pneumonia, renal failure, refractory disease, and cardiac events. Staging systems, such as the revised International Staging System (r-ISS), and prognostic factors including cytogenetics, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and myeloma-specific factors, are useful to assess overall prognosis; however, they cannot predict EM We evaluated patients treated with novel agents in the Connect MM(®) Registry and identified risk factors of the EM cohort. Eligible patients were enrolled in the registry within 60 days of diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between baseline characteristics and EM Prediction matrices for EM were constructed from a logistic model. Between September 2009 and December 2011, 1493 patients were enrolled in the registry and had adequate follow-up. Of these patients, 102 (6.8%) had EM and 1391 (93.2%) survived for > 180 days. Baseline factors significantly associated with increased EM risk included age > 75 years, higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, lower EQ-5D mobility score, higher ISS stage, lower platelet count, and prior hypertension. Renal insufficiency trended toward increased EM risk. These risk factors were incorporated into a prediction matrix for EM. The EM prediction matrix uses differential weighting of risk factors to calculate EM risk in patients with NDMM. Identifying patients at risk for EM may provide new opportunities to implement patient-specific treatment strategies to improve outcomes",10.1002/ajh.24796,0

This study identifies clinical vulnerabilities for suicidal ideation in cardiac patients. METHODS: The primary outcome of the study was severity of suicidal ideation as measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) item No. 9. Covariates were demographics, cardiac characteristics (i.e., Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina rating of chest pain and New York Heart Association rating of shortness of breath), depression (PHQ-8,i.e., PHQ-9 minus item No. 9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), somatic symptoms (PHQ-15), illness perception (Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire), and health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5D, EQ 5D). RESULTS: Data from 1,976 patients were analysed. At least 14% (95% CI [12%, 16%]) of patients indicated suicidal ideations within the last 2 weeks. Bivariate analyses yielded associations between suicidal ideation and higher levels of depression severity, anxiety severity, somatic symptom burden, chest pain, shortness of breath, negative illness perceptions, reduced health-related quality of life, and a higher probability of living alone (all p < 0.001). A multivariable ordinal regression revealed depression severity and anxiety severity to show the highest associations with suicidal ideation (OR(PHQ-8) = 1.22, p < 0.001; OR(GAD-7)  = 1.09, p < 0.001). Having a defibrillator implant was associated with a lower probability of suicidal ideation (OR = 0.27, p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several clinical vulnerabilities of suicidal ideation. The results stress the importance of screening for suicidal ideation in clinical practice",10.1002/cpp.2305,1
4996,A Cost Utility Analysis of Minimally Invasive Surgery with Thrombolysis Compared to Standard Medical Treatment in Spontaneous Intracerebral Haemorrhagic Stroke,"Cost-Benefit Analysis; Health Care Costs; Hemorrhagic Stroke/diagnostic imaging/economics/therapy; Humans; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/economics; Models, Economic; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; State Medicine/economics; Thrombolytic Therapy/adverse effects/economics; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; United Kingdom; Cost-utility analysis; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Minimally invasive surgery; Thrombolysis","OBJECTIVES: Standard medical management of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and surgical hematoma evacuation starkly differ, and whilst landmark randomised control trials report no clinical benefit of early surgical evacuation compared with medical treatment in supratentorial ICH, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with thrombolysis has been neglected within these studies. However, recent technological advancements in MIS have renewed interest in the surgical treatment of ICH. Several economic evaluations have focused on the benefits of MIS in ischaemic stroke management, but no economic evaluations have yet been performed comparing MIS to standard medical treatment for ICH. MATERIALS AND METHOD: All costs were sourced from the UK in GBP. Where possible, the 2019/2020 NHS reference costs were used. The MISTIE III study was used to analyse the outcomes of patients undergoing either MIS or standard medical treatment in this economic evaluation. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for MIS was £485,240.26 for every quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Although MIS resulted in a higher QALY compared to medical treatment, the gain was insignificant at 0.011 QALY. Four sensitivity analyses based on combinations of alternative EQ-5D values and categorisation of MIS outcomes, alongside alterations to the cost of significant adverse events, were performed to check the robustness of the ICER calculation. The most realistic sensitivity analysis showed a potential increase in cost effectiveness when clot size is reduced to <15ml, with the ICER falling to £74,335.57. DISCUSSION: From the perspective of the NHS, MIS with thrombolysis is not cost-effective compared to optimal medical treatment. ICER shows that intention-to-treat MIS would require a cost of £485,240.26 to gain one extra QALY, which is significantly above the NHS threshold of £30,000. Further UK studies with ICH survivor utilities, more replicable surgical technique, and the reporting of clot size reduction are indicated as the present sensitivity analysis suggests that MIS is promising Greater detail about outcomes and complications would ensure improved cost-benefit analyses and support valid and efficient allocation of resources by the NHS",10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105934,0

T2DM prevalence has risen dramatically from around 1 % in the 1980s to now over 10 % and is expected to continue rising. Despite the growing disease burden, few people with T2DM are achieving adequate management targets to prevent complications. Health system infrastructure in China is struggling to meet these gaps in care, and innovative, cost-effective and affordable solutions are needed One promising strategy that may be particularly relevant to the Chinese context is improving support for lay family members to care for their relatives with T2DM. METHODS: We hypothesise that an interactive mobile health management system can support lay family health promoters (FHP) and healthcare staff to improve clinical outcomes for family members with T2DM through medical assessment, regular monitoring, lifestyle advice and the prescribing of guidelines recommended medications. This intervention will be implemented as a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 80 communities (40 communities in Beijing and 40 rural villages in Hebei province) and 2000 people with T2DM. Outcome analyses will be conducted blinded to intervention allocation. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients achieving ≥2 ""ABC"" goals (HbA1c <7.0 %, blood pressure (BP) <140/80 mmHg and LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl or 2.6 mmol/L) at the end of follow-up (Diabetes Care 36(Supplement 1):S11-S66, 2013). Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients achieving individual ABC targets; mean changes in HbA1c, BP, LDL, renal function (serum creatinine and urinary albumin), body mass index, quality of life (QOL, EQ-5D), and healthcare utilisation from baseline; and cost-effectiveness/utility of intervention. Trial outcomes will be accompanied by detailed process and economic evaluations DISCUSSION: The Chinese government has prioritised prevention and treatment of diabetes as 1 of 11 National Basic Public Health Services. Despite great promise for mHealth interventions to improve access to effective health care, there remains uncertainty about how this can be successfully achieved. The findings are likely to inform policy on a scalable strategy to overcome sub-optimal access to effective health care in China.

We investigate the comparability of the PROMIS Profile 29, a generic health-related quality of life measure, in general population samples in the UK, France, and Germany and present general population reference values. METHODS: A web-based survey was simultaneously conducted in the UK (n = 1509), France (1501), and Germany (1502) Along with the PROMIS Profile 29, we collected sociodemographic information as well as the EQ-5D. We tested measurement invariance by means of multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Differences in the health-related quality of life between countries were modeled by linear regression analysis. We present general population reference data for the included PROMIS domains utilizing plausible value imputation and quantile regression. RESULTS: Multigroup CFA of the PROMIS Profile 29 showed that factor means are insensitive to potential measurement bias except in one item. We observed significant differences in patient-reported health between countries, which could be partially explained by the differences in overall ratings of health. The physical function and pain interference scales showed considerable floor effects in the normal population in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Scores derived from the PROMIS Profile 29 are largely comparable across the UK, France, and Germany. Due to the use of plausible value imputation, the presented general population reference values can be compared to data collected with other PROMIS short forms or computer-adaptive tests",10.1007/s11136-018-1785-8,0

Our aim was to examine whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation would improve these measures as compared to standard-dose vitamin D, as well as the possible muscular effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding vitamin D-related enzymes. DESIGN: A 12-month randomized, double-blind, controlled trial where the participants received daily elemental calcium (1000 mg) plus vitamin D(3) (800 IU). In addition, the participants were randomized to receive either capsules with vitamin D(3) (20 000 IU) or matching placebos to be taken twice a week. PATIENTS: A total of 297 postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis. MEASUREMENTS: Muscle strength (handgrip and knee extensor strength), balance (tandem test) and quality of life (EQ-5D) were measured at baseline and after 12 months. The subjects were genotyped for SNPs related to vitamin D metabolism. RESULTS: Of the 297 included women, 275 completed the study. Mean serum 25(OH)D levels dramatically increased in the high-dose group (from 64.7 to 164.1 nmol/L; P<.01), while a more moderate increased was observed in the standard-dose group (from 64.1 to 81.8 nmol/L; P<.01). There was no significant difference between the groups in change in muscular strength, balance or quality of life over the intervention period Polymorphisms in rs3829251 (located in the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene) were associated with muscle strength and treatment effects. CONCLUSION: One-year treatment with high-dose vitamin D had no effect on muscular strength, balance or quality of life in postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis as compared to standard dose. The association between rs3829251 and muscle strength needs confirmation in other populations",10.1111/cen.13353,1
5808,Quality of Life Following Prestige LP Cervical Disc Arthroplasty in a Prospective Multicountry Study,cervical spine; Prestige LP Cervical Disc; arthroplasty; degenerative disc disease; quality of life,"BACKGROUND: To describe routine surgical practice using Prestige LP Cervical Disc (Prestige disc) and patient outcomes for degenerative cervical disc disease in a multicenter 2-year prospective, observational study. METHODS: Patient demographics and intraoperative data were collected; quality of life (QoL) (EQ-5D, EQ-VAS, and neck disability index), average disc height, and adverse events were assessed pre- and postoperatively at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-four patients were enrolled (190 patients implanted; female: 67%; mean age: 44.0 years; mean body mass index: 25.6). Disc herniation was the most frequent indication for cervical arthroplasty (80.5%) Thirty-seven percent of patients experienced pain for >1 year prior to baseline assessment. Mean procedure duration was 87.1 minutes, and mean blood loss was 43.8 mL. The majority (71.0%) of Prestige discs were implanted at level C5 to C6, while 16.3% of patients received implants at 2 levels. There was a significant improvement from baseline to 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up in all QoL assessments. After implantation, the mean disc height at the affected level increased by 0.19 from baseline (0.22) to 3 months (0.41) and remained constant up to 24 months (P < .001). Mean disc height of levels above and below the implant remained comparable at baseline and follow-up. A total of 63 adverse events (44 patients) was recorded, of which 7 (11.1%) were related to the Prestige disc, instrumentation, or procedure; 41 (65.1%) were unrelated; and 15 (23.8%) had an unknown relation. CONCLUSIONS: In line with published findings, our study shows significant improvement in outcomes in the first 3 months after Prestige disc implantation with improvements maintained throughout the study",10.14444/6030,1

Spa therapy is frequently used to treat low back pain, but the associated level of evidence for efficacy is insufficient. To fill this knowledge gap, this protocol proposes an appropriately powered, prospective, evaluator-blinded, multi-centre, two-parallel-arm, randomised (1:1), controlled trial that will compare spa therapy in addition to usual care including home exercise (UCHE) versus UCHE alone for the treatment of chronic low back pain METHODS: Eligible patients (anticipated sample size of 358) will have had low back pain for more than 3 months and scores for pain greater than 40 mm on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Following initial consent for UCHE and baseline evaluations, patients are randomised (1:1) to UCHE alone, or UCHE plus spa therapy (18 days of mud packs, underwater massages, showers and water exercises under medical supervision). Patients in the latter arm will be requested to sign an additional consent form as per Zelen randomisation. Follow-up visits will occur at approximately months 1, 6 and 12 and (along with baseline assessments) will cover changes over time in VAS pain scores, the impact of lower back pain on daily life (the Rolland and Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)), inappropriate fears and beliefs about lower back pain (the fear, avoidance, belief questionnaire (FABQ)), general quality of life (the Euroqol Group 5 dimension, 5 level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5 L)), Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS), consumption of analgesic drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and overall state of health. Health resource use and days of sick leave (and subsequently the associated costs) will also be recorded. The primary outcome is the presence/absence of a clinically relevant change (improvement of at least 30%) in the VAS score for pain at 6 months. DISCUSSION: Despite the fact that previous, rather dated recommendations encourage spa therapy for the treatment of low back pain, the current literary corpus is methodologically poor This protocol has been designed to provide results spanning a thorough range of outcomes at the highest evidence level possible.

DESIGN: A non-experimental descriptive long-term follow-up study. METHODS: Baseline data (n = 416) were collected in 2013, with follow-up data collected in 2019 (n = 154), using the EuroQoL scale, EuroQoL visual analogue scale, and Adherence of Patients with Chronic Disease Instrument. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multivariate methods. RESULTS: The average age of the 154 respondents was 68.5 years (SD 7.01), with a majority males (n = 118, 86.6%). Adherence to a healthy lifestyle, good perceived results of care, support from nurses, high sense of normality, low fear of complications, motivation, older age, and duration of coronary artery disease were associated with better general perceived health as well as its dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). CONCLUSION: Support from nurses is a key factor to ensuring high perceived health among post-percutaneous coronary intervention patients. This support must be continuous and motivate the patient to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. Patients should feel comfortable sharing their problems and fears. This type of relationship will allow health care professionals to assess the patient's current situation and address potential problems about mobility, pain and discomfort, as well as anxiety and depression to strengthen the patient's sense of normality and enable them to confidently lead a normal life. IMPACT: The research aimed to gain knowledge about how perceived health is associated with treatment adherence six years after percutaneous coronary intervention. The results emphasise that a nurse's support of patients is crucial to the care process, as adherence to treatment showed a clear positive association with perceived health in the analysed sample of post-PCI patients",10.1111/jan.15069,0

The aim of this study was to determine if participating in golf is associated with greater functional outcomes, satisfaction, or improvement in quality of life (QoL) compared to non-golfers. METHODS: All patients undergoing primary THA over a one-year period at a single institution were included with one-year postoperative outcomes. Patients were retrospectively followed up to assess if they had been golfers at the time of their surgery. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to assess the independent association of preoperative golfing status on outcomes. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of a total of 308 patients undergoing THA, of whom 44 were golfers (14%). This included 120 male patients (39%) and 188 female patients (61%), with an overall mean age of 67.8 years (SD 11.6). Golfers had a greater mean postoperative Oxford Hip Score (OHS) (3.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 5.5); p < 0.001) and EuroQol visual analogue scale (5.5 (95% CI 0.1 to 11.9); p = 0.039). However, there were no differences in EuroQoL five-dimension score (p = 0.124), pain visual analogue scale (p = 0.505), or Forgotten Joint Score (p = 0.215). When adjusting for confounders, golfers had a greater improvement in their Oxford Hip Score (2.7 (95% CI 0.2 to 5.3); p < 0.001) compared to non-golfers. Of the 44 patients who reported being golfers at the time of their surgery, 32 (72.7%) returned to golf and 84.4% of those were satisfied with their involvement in golf following surgery. Those who returned to golf were more likely to be male (p = 0.039) and had higher (better) preoperative health-related QoL (p = 0.040) and hip-related functional scores (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Golfers had a greater improvement in their hip-specific function compared to non-golfers after THA However, less than three-quarters of patients return to golf, with male patients and those who had greater preoperative QoL or hip-related function being more likely to return to play.

OBJECTIVE: The comparison of HAL with RBL for the treatment of grade II/III haemorrhoids. DESIGN: A multicentre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial. PERSPECTIVE: UK NHS and Personal Social Services. SETTING: 17 NHS Trusts PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years presenting with grade II/III (second- and third-degree) haemorrhoids, including those who have undergone previous RBL INTERVENTIONS: HAL with Doppler probe compared with RBL. OUTCOMES: Primary outcome - recurrence at 1 year post procedure; secondary outcomes - recurrence at 6 weeks; haemorrhoid severity score; European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, 5-level version (EQ-5D-5L); Vaizey incontinence score; pain assessment; complications; and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: A total of 370 participants entered the trial. At 1 year post procedure, 30% of the HAL group had evidence of recurrence compared with 49% after RBL [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 3.51; p = 0.0005]. The main reason for the difference was the number of extra procedures required to achieve improvement/cure. If a single HAL is compared with multiple RBLs then only 37.5% recurred in the RBL arm (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.15; p = 0.20) Persistence of significant symptoms at 6 weeks was lower in both arms than at 1 year (9% HAL and 29% RBL), suggesting significant deterioration in both groups over the year. Symptom score, EQ-5D-5L and Vaizey score improved in both groups compared with baseline, but there was no difference between interventions. Pain was less severe and of shorter duration in the RBL group; most of the HAL group who had pain had mild to moderate pain, resolving by 3 weeks. Complications were low frequency and not significantly different between groups. It appeared that HAL was not cost-effective compared with RBL. In the base-case analysis, the difference in mean total costs was £1027 higher for HAL. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were higher for HAL; however, the difference was very small (0.01) resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £104,427 per additional QALY. CONCLUSIONS: At 1 year, although HAL resulted in fewer recurrences, recurrence was similar to repeat RBL. Symptom scores, complications, EQ-5D-5L and continence score were no different, and patients had more pain in the early postoperative period after HAL. HAL is more expensive and unlikely to be cost-effective in terms of incremental cost per QALY. LIMITATIONS: Blinding of participants and site staff was not possible. FUTURE WORK: The incidence of recurrence may continue to increase with time. Further follow-up would add to the evidence regarding long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The polysymptomatic nature of haemorrhoidal disease requires a validated scoring system, and the data from this trial will allow further assessment of validity of such a system. These data add to the literature regarding treatment of grade II/III haemorrhoids. The results dovetail with results from the eTHoS study [Watson AJM, Hudson J, Wood J, Kilonzo M, Brown SR, McDonald A, et al.

METHODS: In all, 610 adult patients were enrolled into the Medication Overuse Treatment Strategy trial from 34 healthcare clinics, including headache specialty, general neurology, and primary care clinics. Descriptive statistics characterize baseline demographics, headache characteristics, medication use, disability (Headache Impact Test 6 [HIT-6] and Migraine Functional Impact Questionnaire [MFIQ]), pain interference (PROMIS Pain Interference), and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). Relationships with headache frequency were assessed. RESULTS: Mean age was 45 years (SD 13) and 531/608 (87.3%) were females. Mean headache days per 30 was 24.3 (SD 5.5), including 13.6 (SD 7.1) with moderate to severe headache. Daily headaches were reported by 36.1% (219/607) of patients. Acute headache medications were used on 21.5 (SD 7.5) per 30 days. The most commonly overused medications were simple analgesics (378/607, 62% of patients), combination analgesics (246/607, 41%), and triptans (128/607, 21%). HIT-6, MFIQ, PROMIS Pain Interference, and EQ-5D-5L scores demonstrated substantial negative impact from CM with MOH on patient functioning and quality of life. Higher headache frequency was associated with more moderate-severe headache days, more frequent acute headache medication use, greater headache-related disability, and lower quality of life. Only 272/606 (44.9%) were taking migraine preventive medication. CONCLUSIONS: CM with MOH is associated with a large burden on patients in the United States. Higher headache frequency is associated with greater impact on functioning, pain interference, and quality of life",10.1111/head.14056,1
6987,"Mortality, functional outcomes and quality of life after hip fractures complicated by infection: a case control study",na,"Introduction: Infection is a detrimental complication of operatively treated hip fractures. The objective of this retrospective case-control study was to evaluate the mortality, the physical function and the quality of life of hip fractures complicated with infection and determine risk factors for deep infection in hip fractures. Patients and methods: All patients with hip fractures (31A and 31B OTA/AO) that were operatively managed over a 10-year period that subsequently developed deep infection were included in the study. Thirty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. These patients were compared with a matched control group of 198 patients without infection. Minimum follow-up was 1 year. Mortality, Barthel index score, EQ-5D-5L, Parker mobility score and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score were compared between groups. Results: Mortality at 1 month was 20.5 % and 43 % at 1 year. Half of the infections were acute and 28 % were polymicrobial Mortality was greater in the infection group (43 % vs. 16.5 %, p < 0.0014 ), and Barthel index was inferior in the infection group (14 vs. 18, p < 0.0017 ) compared to control group. Logistic regression analysis revealed that time from admission to surgery was a negative factor that predisposed to infection Conclusions: Patients complicated with infection after a hip fracture have higher mortality and inferior functional results. Delay from admission to surgery predisposes to infection",10.5194/jbji-6-347-2021,1

RESULTS: The survey received 584 unique responses from caregivers of paediatric (83%) and adult (17%) patients with Dravet syndrome (aged <1-48y). Despite broadly following current treatment guidance, less than 10% of patients were seizure free in the previous 3 months. Nearly all (99.6%) patients aged 5 years or older experienced at least one or more motor, speech, learning, or behavioural impairment. High seizure frequency was related to more reports of emergency treatment, comorbidities, and a lower QoL (as measured by the standardized instrument EQ-5D-5L). If not diagnosed at the first instance, the majority (83%) of adults, but less than 20% of 6- to 11-year-olds were diagnosed after 4 or more years. INTERPRETATION: Patients with Dravet syndrome with the highest current seizure frequency suffer from more comorbidities and have a lower QoL. Therefore, more effective antiepileptic treatments are needed. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The survey captured about 15% of all patients with Dravet syndrome in Europe. Less than 10% of patients had current seizure freedom. Patients with a high current seizure burden have more comorbidities and lower quality of life",10.1111/dmcn.13591,1

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We developed and validated the Upper Limb Lymphedema Quality of Life (ULLQoL) scale in two stages: devising the items and pretesting with patients and clinicians; longitudinal validation to test its psychometric properties-underlying dimensions, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness. Patients with ULL were recruited from two outpatient clinics RESULTS: We derived the ULLQoL scale from a pool of 98 items generated by patients. After further consultation, we produced the draft ULLQoL scale. For validation, 103 patients with ULL completed the draft scale and two generic health measures: SF-36 and ED-5D-3L. Psychometric analysis identified two components, physical and emotional well-being, with good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Significant correlations with SF-36, EQ-5D-3L, and percentage excess limb volume confirmed construct validity. The ULLQoL scale showed good responsiveness to change reported by lymphedema patients and moderate to large effect sizes. CONCLUSION: The 14-item ULLQoL scale is a robust ULL-specific measure that is feasible and valid to use in both the clinical and research settings",10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.04.014,0

Although specialized rheumatology nurses could take over substantial aspects of patient care, this hardly occurs in Germany. Thus, the aim of the study is to examine structured nursing consultation in rheumatology practices METHODS/DESIGN: In total, 800 patients with a stable course of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in 20 centers in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony will be randomized to either nurse-led care or standard care Participating nurses will study for a special qualification in rheumatology and trial-specific issues. It is hypothesized that nurse-led care is non-inferior to standard care provided by rheumatologists with regard to a reduction of disease activity (DAS28) while it is hypothesized to be superior regarding changes in health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) after 1 year. Secondary outcomes include functional capacity, patient satisfaction with treatment, and resource consumption. DISCUSSION: Since there is insufficient care of rheumatology patients in Germany, the study may be able to suggest improvements. Nurse-led care has the potential to provide more efficient and effective patient care. This includes a more stringent implementation of the treat-to-target concept, which may lead to a higher percentage of patients reaching their treatment targets, thereby improving patient-related outcomes, such as quality of life, functional capacity, and participation. Additionally, nurse-led care may be highly cost-effective. Finally, this project may form the basis for a sustainable implementation of nurse-led care in standard rheumatology care in Germany.

The purpose of our study was to conduct a randomised trial comparing ACR versus MUA to assess the difference in outcome, complications and cost-effectiveness of both procedures. METHODS: From May 2020 to June 2021, patients presenting with FS were randomised into two groups ACR (n = 44) and MUA (n = 41). Patients with arthritis, full-thickness cuff tears, history of trauma/previous surgery around the shoulder were excluded from the study. Range of movement (ROM), pain grading using visual analogue scale (VAS), functional scores- UCLA, CONSTANT and EuroQol-5D scores were measured pre-operatively and post-operatively. MRI was done at three weeks post-operatively for screening complications of either procedure. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was used for cost-analysis RESULTS: Post-operatively, patients had significant improvement in pain, ROM and functional scores in both groups (P < 0.001) with no significant difference between groups at 24 weeks of follow-up. Diabetic patients undergoing ACR had lesser improvement in abduction and external rotation when compared to non-diabetic patients. Labral tears in MUA group and bone bruises in ACR group were the most common complications noted on the post-operative MRI. For ACR cost per QALY gained was 896 USD while that for MUA was 424 USD. CONCLUSION: Both ACR and MUA resulted in good improvement in pain and shoulder function. Good outcomes, simple technique and better cost-effectiveness would still make MUA an attractive option over ACR for treating FS",10.1007/s00264-022-05558-z,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients from the ongoing proSTatic aRtery EmbolizAtion for the treatMent of benign prostatic hyperplasia (STREAM) trial were identified as having AdBPH; defined as two or more adenomas within the central gland of ≥1 cm diameter on multi-parametric MRI (MP-MRI) These patients were age-matched with patients from the STREAM cohort, without AdBPH. Patients were followed up with repeat MP-MRI at 3 months and 1 year International prostate symptom score (IPSS), international index for erectile function (IIEF), and quality of life assessment from the IPSS and EQ-5D-5S questionnaires were recorded pre-PAE and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 68 (61-76). All patients had PAE as a day-case procedure. The technical success in the cohort was 23/24 (96%). There was a significant reduction in prostate volume following embolization with a median reduction of 34% (30-55) in the AdBPH group, compared to a mean volume reduction of 22% (9-44) in the non-AdBPH group (p = 0.04). There was a significant reduction in IPSS in the AdBPH group following PAE when compared with the control group [AdBPH median IPSS 8 (3-15) vs. non-AdBPH median IPSS 13 (8-18), p = 0.01]. IPSS QOL scores significantly improved in the AdBPH group (p = 0.007). There was no deterioration in sexual function in either group post-PAE. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time that AdBPH has been identified as being a predictor of clinical success following PAE",10.1007/s00270-017-1602-8,1

METHODS: Two hundred five patients were included and categorized into four groups; 102 patients into the decompression-alone group with MCs, 41 patients into the fusion group with MCs, 46 patients into the decompression-alone group without MCs, and 16 patients into the fusion group without MCs. Clinical outcome was quantified with changes in spinal stenosis measure (SSM) symptoms, SSM function, NRS pain, and EQ-5D-3L sum score over time (measured at baseline, 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up) and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in SSM symptoms, SSM function, and NRS pain from baseline to 36-month follow-up. To investigate if possible effects of MCs had been modified or hidden by confounding variables, we used the group LASSO method to search for good prognostic models. RESULTS: There were no obvious differences in any of the clinical outcome measures between groups at baseline. At 12 months, most patients have improved in all outcomes and maintained improved conditions over time (no significant group differences). Between 70 and 90 percent of the patients maintained a clinically important improvement up to 36 months CONCLUSIONS: Endplate MCs have no significant influence on clinical outcome parameters in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis compared to patients without MCs, independent of the chosen surgical strategy. All patients benefitted from surgical therapy up to 36-month follow-up. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material",10.1007/s00586-020-06364-0,1

METHODS: Patients who underwent EPA for bulbar stricture between 2012 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed (n = 308) Successful urethroplasty was defined as the absence of the need for additional treatment. For follow-up, uroflowmetry was performed and the patients completed the validated Urethral Stricture Surgery Patient-reported Outcome Measure and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) questionnaires before (baseline) and 6 months after EPA. Overall patient satisfaction after urethroplasty was also evaluated. RESULTS: Urethroplasty was successful in 97.1% of patients (n = 299) with a median follow-up of 37 months. A total of 215 patients (69.8%) completed the questionnaires at 6 months postoperatively. The mean maximum flow rate, lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS)-total score, Peeling's picture score, LUTS-specific quality of life, and EuroQol-visual analog scale scores improved significantly from 7.7 ml/s, 11.6, 3.3, 2.4, and 58.0 at baseline to 24.1 ml/s, 2.7, 1.9, 0.4, and 82.1 postoperatively (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). However, five-point or greater deterioration in the SHIM score was found in 41 patients (19.1%) Regarding patient satisfaction, 98.6% of patients (212/215) were ""satisfied"" (32.6%) or ""very satisfied"" (66.0%) with the outcome. A low postoperative LUTS-total score and Peeling's picture score were independent predictors of a ""very satisfied"" patient (p = 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: EPA had a high success rate and was associated with significant benefits in both subjective and objective outcomes. Contrarily, a high incidence of postoperative erectile dysfunction was observed",10.1007/s00345-020-03539-8,1

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is considered one of the most effective treatments for end-stage hip osteoarthritis. The number of THAs is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades. Usual postoperative rehabilitation after primary THA differs between the German and the Dutch system. In the Netherlands, patients undergo fast-track surgery and are discharged into their home environment within a few days without receiving any aftercare. In Germany, patients stay in the hospital for about 12 days before being transferred to a rehabilitation centre for a period of 3 weeks. The superficially more cost-effective Dutch system of usual care after THA is judged critically in both countries due to suboptimal rehabilitation outcomes. The aim of this study is therefore to compare the Dutch with the German usual care rehabilitation after primary THA. It is hypothesised that the German procedure is more effective in terms of functional outcomes and patient satisfaction than the Dutch procedure and that in the long run the German approach is more cost-effective than the Dutch system. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Medical effectiveness will be assessed at four different time points by means of patient self-reported questionnaires and functional tests. Assessments include the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Patient Acceptable Symptom State, Short Form 36, EuroQol 5 Dimensions 3 Level Questionnaire, Timed Up & Go Test and Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test. Additionally, long-term economic aspects in both countries will be assessed from a societal perspective, to get a first impression on whether cutting costs for rehabilitation, as practised in the Netherlands, really disburdens the healthcare system efficiently. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both University Medical Center Groningen (METc2015/483) and Hannover Medical School (no 2874-2015) and will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (64th, 2013). The results of the study will be published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. Patient data will be presented anonymously in any publication or scientific journal.

8826,Chronic low back pain and the risk of depression or anxiety symptoms: insights from a longitudinal twin study,"Adult; Depression/epidemiology/etiology/genetics; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain/complications/epidemiology/genetics; Male; Middle Aged; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic; Anxiety; Chronic low back pain; Depression; Epidemiology; Genetics; Twins","BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Pain is commonly associated with symptoms of depression or anxiety, although this relationship is considered bidirectional. There is limited knowledge regarding causal relationships. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate whether chronic low back pain (LBP) increases the risk of depression or anxiety symptoms, after adjusting for shared familial factors. STUDY DESIGN: This is a longitudinal, genetically informative study design from the Murcia Twin Registry in Spain. PATIENT SAMPLE: The patient sample included 1,269 adult twins with a mean age of 53 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome of depression or anxiety symptoms was evaluated with EuroQol questionnaire. METHODS: Using logistic regression analyses, twins were initially assessed as individuals in the total sample analysis, followed by a co-twin case-control, which was partially (dizygotic [DZ] twins) and fully (monozygotic [MZ] twins) adjusted for shared familial factors. There was no external funding for this study and no conflict of interest was declared. RESULTS: There was a significant association between chronic LBP and the risk of depression or anxiety symptoms in the unadjusted total sample analysis (odds ratio [OR]: 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-2.44). After adjusting for confounders, the association remained significant (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.05-1.95), although the adjusted co-twin case-control was non-significant in DZ (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.50-2.13) and MZ twins (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 0.63-5.51). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between chronic LBP and the future development of depression or anxiety symptoms is not causal. The relationship is likely to be explained by confounding from shared familial factors, given the non-statistically significant associations in the co-twin case-control analyses",10.1016/j.spinee.2017.02.009,0
8829,Functional recovery after treatment of extra-articular distal radius fractures in the elderly using the IlluminOss® System (IO-Wrist); a multicenter prospective observational study,"Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary/instrumentation; Humans; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures/instrumentation; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Prospective Studies; Radius Fractures/surgery; Recovery of Function; Research Design; Wrist Injuries/surgery; Costs; Distal radius fracture; Elderly; Extra-articular; Fracture; Intramedullary; Outcome","BACKGROUND: Approximately 17 % of all fractures involve the distal radius Two-thirds require reduction due to displacement. High redislocation rates and functional disability remain a significant problem after non-operative treatment, with up to 30 % of patients suffering long-term functional restrictions. Whether operative correction is superior to non-operative treatment with respect to functional outcome has not unequivocally been confirmed. The IlluminOss® System was introduced in 2009 as a novel, patient-specific, and minimally invasive intramedullary fracture fixation. This minimally invasive technique has a much lower risk of iatrogenic soft tissue complications. Because IlluminOss® allows for early mobilization, it may theoretically lead to earlier functional recovery and ADL independence than non-operative immobilization. The main aim of this study is to examine outcome in elderly patients who sustained a unilateral, displaced, extra-articular distal radius fracture that was treated with IlluminOss®. METHODS/DESIGN: The design of the study will be a multicenter, prospective, observational study (case series). The study population comprises elderly (60 years or older; independent in activities of daily living) with a unilateral, displaced, extra-articular distal radius fracture (AO/OTA type 23-A2 and A3) that after successful closed reduction was fixed within 2 weeks after the injury with IlluminOss®. Critical elements of treatment will be registered, and outcome will be monitored until 1 year after surgery. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score will serve as primary outcome measure. The Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation score, level of pain, health-related quality of life (Short Form-36 and EuroQoL-5D), time to ADL independence, time to activities/work resumption, range of motion of the wrist, radiological outcome, and complications are secondary outcome measures. Health care consumption and lost productivity will be used for a cost analysis. The cost analysis will be performed from a societal perspective. Descriptive data will be reported DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of operative treatment of patients who sustained an extra-articular distal radius fracture with the IlluminOss® System, using clinical, patient-reported, and societal outcomes.

METHODS: Of 276 patients from eight centers in Belgium who began treatment prior to 31 December 2017, effectiveness assessment data were available for 238 patients during the test period of 4 to 8/12 weeks, and for smaller patient cohorts with continued treatment for 6/12 months. RESULTS: Mean 0-10 spasticity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores improved from 8.1 at baseline to 5.2 (week 4), 4.6 (week 8) and 4.1 (week 12). Mean EuroQoL Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) scores increased from 39 at baseline to 52 (week 4), 57 (week 8) and 59 (week 12). Mean NRS and EQ VAS scores remained in the same 12 weeks' range in patients with longer-term data The average dose of cannabinoid oromucosal spray was 6 sprays/day. Most of the 93 out of 276 patients, with initial prescription (33.7%), who discontinued treatment by week 12 did so within the first 8 weeks, mainly due to lack of effectiveness. By week 12, 171 (74%) of the 230 effectiveness evaluable patients reported a clinically meaningful response, corresponding to ≥30% NRS improvement The tolerability of cannabinoid oromucosal spray was consistent with its known safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: More than 60% of the patients with MS who started add-on treatment with cannabinoid oromucosal spray reported a clinically relevant symptomatic effect and continued treatment after 12 weeks",10.1186/s12883-021-02246-0,0

METHODS: The MHQoL dimensions were based on prior research by Connell and colleagues, highlighting the seven most important quality of life dimensions in the context of mental health. Items were generated following a systematic review we performed and through inviting expert opinion. A focus group and an online qualitative study (N = 120) were carried out to assess the face and content validity of the MHQoL The MHQoL was further tested for its internal consistency, convergent validity, known-group validity and test-retest reliability among mental healthcare service users (N = 479) and members of the general population (N = 110). RESULTS: The MHQoL consists of a descriptive system (MHQoL-7D), including s items covering seven dimensions (self-image, independence, mood, relationships, daily activities, physical health, future) and a visual analogue scale of general psychological well-being (MHQoL-VAS). Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's ∝ = 0.85) and correlations between MHQoL-7D scores and related measures (EQ-5D-5L, MANSA, ICECAP-A, and BSI) supported convergent validity. The intraclass correlation coefficient of the MHQoL-7D sum score for test-retest reliability was 0.85. Known-group validity was supported by the ability to detect significant differences in MHQoL-7D levels between service users and the general population, and between groups with different levels of psychological distress CONCLUSION: The MHQoL demonstrated favourable psychometric properties and showed promise as a simple and effective measure to assess quality of life in people with mental health problems",10.1007/s11136-021-02935-w,0
9080,Long-Term Efficacy of a Novel Spinal Cord Stimulation Clinical Workflow Using Kilohertz Stimulation: Twelve-Month Results From the Vectors Study,Chronic Pain/therapy; Humans; Pain Measurement; Quality of Life; Spinal Cord; Spinal Cord Stimulation; Treatment Outcome; Workflow; Chronic neuropathic pain; functional outcomes; high-frequency stimulation; pain relief; prospective,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Multiple variables play a role in spinal cord stimulation (SCS) treatment outcomes, including patient anatomy, pain pattern, lead location, stimulation parameters, and so on. A wide range of stimulation parameters are considered safe and on-label, and as a result a growing number of new frequencies and frequency-combinations are being incorporated into standard practice. A standardized approach to therapy delivery may provide more consistent outcomes for more patients. The Vectors study evaluated whether there is significant sustained improvement in pain and functional outcomes when therapy is delivered using a standardized approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vectors, a post-market, single-arm study evaluated the safety and efficacy of SCS with an implantable neurostimulator starting with 1 kHz stimulation, targeting the T9-T10 disc space following paresthesia mapping. Subjects with chronic intractable low back and leg pain (visual analogue scale [VAS] ≥ 50 mm) were enrolled. The primary endpoint was change in overall pain (VAS) at the three-month visit compared to baseline. Subjects were followed through 12 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in low back and leg pain, quality of life (European Quality of Life - Five Dimensions, EQ-5D-5L), disability (Oswestry Disability Index, ODI), individual subject goals, and subject satisfaction. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in overall pain (VAS; 45.4 mm) through the three-month visit, which was sustained through 12 months. At 12 months, 79% of subjects had ≥50% improvement in at least one pain domain (overall, lowback or leg) with 85% of subjects reporting therapy satisfaction. There was a decrease in disability and an improvement in quality of life with 70% of subjects achieving a personal activity goal by the three-month visit. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term pain relief and improvement in quality of life and function were achieved when following a standardized workflow.

The outcome measures included the prevalence/incidence of pain (i.e., headache, neck or shoulder pain, upper limb pain, low back pain, and leg pain), pain intensity, and the prevalence of past/present chronic pain. Pain intensity was measured by the pain/discomfort item of the 5-level version of the EuroQol 5 Dimension scale. Odds ratios of pain prevalence/incidence and past/present chronic pain prevalence according to the UCLA-LS3-SF3 scoring groups (tertiles) and the frequency of the perceived increase in social isolation (categories 1-5) were calculated using multinomial logistic regression analysis. The mean pain intensity values among different loneliness and social isolation levels were tested using an analysis of covariance. Increased loneliness and the severity of the perceived social isolation were positively associated with the prevalence/incidence of pain, pain intensity, and the prevalence of past/present chronic pain",10.1038/s41598-021-97136-3,0

The objective of this study was to analyse the prevalence of polypharmacy (defined as ≥8 prescribed drugs), of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and major drug-drug interactions (DDIs) among community-dwelling general practice patients aged ≥75 years and to identify characteristics being associated with polypharmacy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study is derived from baseline data (patients' demographic/biometric characteristics, diagnoses, medication-related data, cognitive/affective status, quality of life) of a northern-Italian cluster-RCT. PIMs and DDIs were assessed using the 2012 Beers criteria and the Lexi-Interact® database. Data were analysed using descriptive methods, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, Fisher's exact tests and Spearman correlations. RESULTS: Of the eligible patients aged 75+, 13.4% were on therapy with ≥8 drugs. Forty-three general practitioners and 579 patients participated in the study. Forty five point nine percent of patients were treated with ≥1 Beers-listed drugs. The most frequent PIMs were benzodiazepines/hypnotics (19.7% of patients) and NSAIDs (6.6%). Sixty seven point five percent of patients were exposed to ≥1 major DDI, 35.2% to ≥2 major DDIs Antithrombotic/anticoagulant medications (30.4%) and antidepressants/antipsychotics (23.1%) were the most frequently interacting drugs. Polypharmacy was significantly associated with a higher number of major DDIs (Spearman's rho 0.33, p < 0.001) and chronic conditions (Spearman's rho 0.20, p < 0.001), higher 5-GDS scores (thus, lower affective status) (Spearman's rho 0.12, p = 0.003) and lower EQ-5D-5L scores (thus, lower quality of life) (Spearman's rho - 0.14, p = 0.001). Patients' age/sex, 6-CIT scores (cognitive status), BMI or PIM use were not correlated with the number of drugs CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of polypharmacy, PIMs and major DDIs was considerable. Results indicate that physicians should particularly observe their patients with multiple conditions, reduced health and affective status, independently from other patients' characteristics. Careful attention about indication, benefit and potential risk should be paid especially to patients on therapy with specific drug classes identified as potentially inappropriate or prone to major DDIs in older persons (e.g., benzodiazepines, NSAIDs, protonic pump inhibitors, antithrombotics/anticoagulants, antidepressants/antipsychotics) TRIAL REGISTRATION: The cluster-RCT on which this cross-sectional analysis is based was registered with Current Controlled Trials Ltd.

The UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends an annual physical health review with signposting to, or provision of, a lifestyle programme to address weight concerns and obesity. The purpose of this randomised controlled trial is to assess whether a group-based structured education programme can help people with schizophrenia to lose weight. METHODS: Design: a randomised controlled trial of a group-based structured education programme. SETTING: 10 UK community mental health trusts PARTICIPANTS: 396 adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or first-episode psychosis who are prescribed antipsychotic medication will be recruited Participants will be overweight, obese or be concerned about their weight INTERVENTION: participants will be randomised to either the intervention or treatment as usual (TAU). The intervention arm will receive TAU plus four 2.5-h weekly sessions of theory-based lifestyle structured group education, with maintenance contact every 2 weeks and 'booster' sessions every 3 months. All participants will receive standardised written information about healthy eating, physical activity, alcohol and smoking. OUTCOMES: the primary outcome is weight (kg) change at 1 year post randomisation. Secondary outcomes, which will be assessed at 3 and 12 months, include: the proportion of participants who maintained or reduced their weight; waist circumference; body mass index; objectively measured physical activity (wrist accelerometer); self-reported diet; blood pressure; fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile and HbA(1c) (baseline and 1 year only); health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L and RAND SF-36); (adapted) brief illness perception questionnaire; the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; the Client Service Receipt Inventory; medication use; smoking status; adverse events; depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9); use of weight-loss programmes; and session feedback (intervention only). Outcome assessors will be blind to trial group allocation. Qualitative interviews with a subsample of facilitators and invention-arm participants will provide data on intervention feasibility and acceptability. Assessment of intervention fidelity will also be performed. DISCUSSION: The STEPWISE trial will provide evidence for the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a tailored intervention, which, if successful, could be implemented rapidly in the NHS.

The brevity and comprehensibility of the tool make it practical for use in clinical and research settings. Although the COMI has been cross-culturally adapted in various languages worldwide, there is currently no Japanese version. The aim of this study was to develop a Japanese version of the COMI by: (1) performing a cross-cultural adaptation of the English version and (2) evaluating the psychometric properties of the Japanese version of the COMI in Japanese volunteers with chronic back problems. METHODS: The English version of the COMI was cross-culturally adapted for the Japanese language using established guidelines. The pre-final version was pilot-tested in five Japanese-speaking patients with low back pain (LBP) and a history of spine surgery. The psychometric properties of the Japanese COMI were tested in a group of 1052 individuals with chronic LBP (LBP ≥3 months), aged 20-69 years, who were recruited through a web-based survey. The psychometric properties that were evaluated included convergent and known-group validity, using the following reference questionnaires: EuroQol 5 Dimension, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, Short Form 8™ Health Survey, and the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool. RESULTS: The pre-final version of the cross-culturally adapted Japanese COMI was completed without any major problems of understanding or acceptability For the evaluation of its psychometric properties, tests for convergent validity showed moderate correlations between COMI items and the respective reference questionnaires for symptom-specific well-being [- 0.33--0.48] and disability domains [0.48] and strong correlations (> 0.5) for the other domains and the COMI summary score. The analysis of known-group validity showed a linear trend for the COMI score in relation to prognostic risk (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese COMI retained conceptual equivalence to the original using comprehensible and acceptable Japanese expressions. We developed a Japanese version of the COMI that displayed qualities that support its convergent and known-group validity. The availability of a Japanese version of the COMI should allow for improved documentation of the care provided to patients with back problems",10.1186/s12891-018-1986-x,1

Although the duration and severity of symptoms can vary, pain persisting beyond 6 weeks is unlikely to recover spontaneously and may require investigation and treatment. Currently, there is no specific care pathway for sciatica in the National Health Service (NHS), and no direct comparison exists between surgical microdiscectomy and transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI). The NERVES (NErve Root block VErsus Surgery) trial aims to address this by comparing clinical and cost-effectiveness of surgical microdiscectomy and TFESI to treat sciatica secondary to a PID. METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 163 patients were recruited from NHS out-patient clinics across the UK and randomised to either microdiscectomy or TFESI. Adult patients (aged 16-65 years) with sciatic pain endured for between 6 weeks and 12 months are eligible if their symptoms have not been improved by at least one form of conservative (non-operative) treatment and they are willing to provide consent. Patients will be excluded if they present with neurological deficit or have had previous surgery at the same level. The primary outcome is patient-reported disability measured using the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) score at 18 weeks post randomisation and secondary outcomes include disability and pain scales using numerical pain ratings, modified Roland-Morris and Core Outcome Measures Index at 12-weekly intervals, and patient satisfaction at 54 weeks. Cost-effectiveness and quality of life (QOL) will be assessed using the EQ-5D-5 L and self-report cost data at 12-weekly intervals and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. Adverse event data will be collected. Analysis will follow the principle of intention-to-treat. DISCUSSION: NERVES is the first trial to evaluate the comparative clinical and cost-effectiveness of microdiscectomy to local anaesthetic and steroid administered via TFESI. The results of this research may facilitate the development of an evidence-based treatment strategy for patients with sciatica TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ID: ISRCTN04820368 .

The purpose of the study was to analyse the construct validity, criterion validity, test-retest reliability and responsiveness of the EQ-5D in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: 152 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease (123 with Crohn's disease and 29 with ulcerative colitis) completed the EQ-5D, the SF-36 and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Of the study group, 66 patients filled in the EQ-5D a second time after a 2-week gap, including a transition question. Disease activity was measured by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and by Rachmilewitz's Clinical Activity Index (CAI). RESULTS: The EQ-5D showed a moderate ceiling effect. Correlation between the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) score and CDAI/CAI was r = -0.65/r = -0.71 (both P < 0.001) Levels of responses to EQ-5D items and the EQ VAS score were significantly better for patients in remission than for patients with active disease (all P < 0.01) For the total sample, coefficients of correlation between the EQ VAS score and SF-36 and IBDQ scores ranged between 0.37 and 0.73 (all P < 0.0001). When repeated, the EQ-5D was reliable in stable patients (intraclass correlation coefficient for EQ VAS = 0.77, kappa statistic for items 0.39 to 1.00); the EQ VAS was responsive in patients who, in the transition question, indicated an improvement in health state (effect size 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: The EQ-5D is reasonably valid, reliable and responsive in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It can be used to generate preference-based valuations of health-related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease",10.1097/00042737-200211000-00008,1

To use the cutoffs for minimal clinically important difference (MCID) as success criteria has a large potential bias, simply because it is difficult to classify patients who report that they are ""moderately improved"". We propose that the criteria for success should be defined by those who report that they are ""completely recovered"" or ""much better"". METHODS: A cohort of 692 patients were operated for lumbar disc herniation and followed for one year in the Norwegian Registry for Spine Surgery. The global perceived scale of change was used as an external criterion, and success was defined as those who reported that they were ""completely recovered"" or ""much better"". Criteria for success for each of (1) the Oswestry disability index (ODI; score range 0-100 where 0 = no disability), (2) the numerical pain scale (NRS; range 0-10 where 0 = no pain) for back and leg pain, and (3) the Euroqol (EQ-5D; -0.6 to 1 where 1 = perfect health) were estimated by defining the optimal cutoff point on receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The cutoff values for success for the mean change scores were 20 (ODI), 2.5 (NRS back), 3.5 (NRS leg), and 0.30 (EQ-5D). According to the cutoff estimates, the proportions of successful outcomes were 66% for the ODI and 67% for the NRS leg pain scale. INTERPRETATION: The sensitivity/specificity values for the ODI and leg pain were acceptable, whereas they were very low for the EQ-5D. The cutoffs for success can be used as benchmarks when comparing data from different surgical units",10.3109/17453674.2013.786634,1

However, using aggregate health outcome scores, such as EQ-5D utilities, for performance assessment purposes causes information loss and raises statistical and normative concerns OBJECTIVES: . For hip replacement surgery, we explore a) the change in patient-reported outcomes between baseline and follow-up on 5 health dimensions (EQ-5D), b) the extent to which treatment impact varies across hospitals, and c) the extent to which hospital performance on EQ-5D dimensions is correlated with performance on the EQ-5D utility index. METHODS: . We combine information on pre- and postoperative EQ-5D outcomes with routine inpatient data for the financial year 2009-2010. The sample consists of 21,000 patients in 153 hospitals. We employ hierarchical ordered probit risk-adjustment models that recognize the multilevel nature of the data and the response distributions. The treatment impact is modeled as a random coefficient that varies at the hospital level. We obtain hospital-specific empirical Bayes (EB) estimates of this coefficient. We estimate separate models for each EQ-5D dimension and the EQ-5D utility index and analyze correlations of EB estimates across these. RESULTS: . Hospital treatment is associated with improvements in all EQ-5D dimensions. Variability in treatment impact is most pronounced on the mobility and usual activities dimensions Conversely, only pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression correlate well with performance measures based on utilities. This leads to different assessments of hospital performance across metrics. CONCLUSIONS: . Our results indicate which hospitals are better than others in improving health across particular EQ-5D dimensions. We demonstrate the importance of evaluating dimensions of the EQ-5D separately for the purposes of hospital performance assessment",10.1177/0272989X13482523,1

The subjects participated in the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice, which was conducted in 2001. Five percent of all listed patients of 104 practices (99% of the Dutch are listed in a general practice) were invited for a health interview. Analyses were prepared for 9685 respondents aged 18 years or more. The EQ-6D is an extended EQ-5D (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) with a cognitive dimension. The EQ-6D construct validity was examined by comparing it with the SF-36, with good results. Most respondents reported no health problems, while 33% reported pain or discomfort. Women and elderly people generally reported more problems; only depression/anxiety was unrelated to age. Educational level was closely related to problems in all dimensions. The cognitive dimension of the EQ-6D, used for the first time in a general population, gave satisfactory results. This paper includes normative data by age and gender for both the EQ-6D and the EQ-5D. We conclude that the EQ-6D is an efficient tool for establishing the health status in the community, so that different population subgroups can be compared",10.1007/s11136-004-1214-z,1

We present a study aimed to evaluate the short- and the long-term outcomes of severe burn patients (total body surface area, TBSA > 40%) treated in a polyvalent intensive care unit (ICU) and to assess the quality of life of survivors, one year after the injury using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. METHODS: A prospective-observational study was performed in an ICU of a University-affiliated hospital. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors predicting in-hospital mortality. The EQ-5D questionnaire was used to asses participant's long term self-reported general health. RESULTS: During a period of five years, 50 patients participated in the study. Their mean age was 53.8 +/- 19.8; they had a mean of %TBSA burned of 54.5 +/- 18.1. 44% and 10% of patients died in the ICU and in the ward after ICU discharge, respectively. Baux index, SAPS II and SOFA on admission to the ICU, infectious and respiratory complications, and time of first burn wound excision were found to have a significant predictive value for hospital mortality. The level of health of all survivors was worse than before the injury Problems in the five dimensions studied were present as follows: mobility (moderate 68.5%; extreme 0%), self-care (moderate 21%; extreme 36.9%), usual activities (moderate 68.5%; extreme 21%), pain/discomfort (moderate 68.5%; extreme 10.5%), anxiety/depression (moderate 36.9%; extreme 42.1%). CONCLUSIONS: In severe burn patients, Baux index, severity of illness on admission to the ICU, complications, and time of first burn wound excision were the major contributors to hospital mortality. Quality of life was influenced by consequences of injury both in psychological and physical health",10.1186/1757-7241-18-24,1

The primary objective of this study was to elicit EQ-5D Polish values using the time trade-off (TTO) method. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews with visitors of inpatients in eight medical centers in Warsaw, Skierniewice, and Puławy were carried out by trained interviewers. Quota sampling was used to achieve a representative sample of the Polish population with regard to age and sex Modified protocol from the Measurement and Value of Health study was used. Each respondent ranked 10 health states and valued 4 health states using the visual analog scale and 23 using the TTO. Mean and variance stability tests were performed to determine whether using a larger number of health states per respondent would yield credible results. Modeling included random effects and random parameters models. RESULTS: Between February and May 2008, 321 interviews were performed. Modeling based on 6777 valuations resulted in an additive model with all coefficients statistically significant, R(2) equal to 0.45, and value -0.523 for the worst possible health state. Means and variance did not differ significantly for states valued in the middle and at the end of the TTO exercise CONCLUSIONS: This is the first EQ-5D value set based on TTO in Central and Eastern Europe so far. Because the values differ considerably from those elicited in Western European countries, its use should be recommended for studies in Poland. Increasing the number of health states that each respondent is asked to value using TTO seems feasible and justifiable",10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00596.x,1

However, evaluating utilities in children presents several challenges since young children may not have the cognitive ability to complete measurement tasks and thus utility values must be estimated by proxy assessors. Another solution is to use utilities derived from an adult population. To better inform the future conduct of cost-utility analyses in paediatric populations, we reviewed the published literature reporting utilities among children and adults across selected conditions common to paediatric and adult populations. METHODS: An electronic search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to November 2008 was conducted to identify studies presenting utility values derived from the Health Utilities Index (HUI) or EuroQoL-5Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaires or using time trade off (TTO) or standard gamble (SG) techniques in children and/or adult populations from randomized controlled trials, comparative or non-comparative observational studies, or cross-sectional studies The search was targeted to four chronic diseases/conditions common to both children and adults and known to have a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). RESULTS: After screening 951 citations identified from the literature search, 77 unique studies included in our review evaluated utilities in patients with asthma (n = 25), cancer (n = 23), diabetes mellitus (n = 11), skin diseases (n = 19) or chronic diseases (n = 2), with some studies evaluating multiple conditions. Utility values were estimated using HUI (n = 33), EQ-5D (n = 26), TTO (n = 12), and SG (n = 14), with some studies applying more than one technique to estimate utility values. 21% of studies evaluated utilities in children, of those the majority being in the area of oncology. No utility values for children were reported in skin diseases. Although few studies provided comparative information on utility values between children and adults, results seem to indicate that utilities may be similar in adolescents and young adults with asthma and acne. Differences in results were observed depending on methods and proxies. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the need to conduct future research regarding measurement of utilities in children",10.1186/1477-7525-8-12,1

Evidence on the impact of pharmacological treatment on symptoms of ADHD and the QoL of the patient and their family is still limited. There is a need for further research on QoL in ADHD as well as the relationship between ADHD and the impact on families rather than solely on patients. AIMS OF THE STUDY: Measure QoL of children with ADHD and their parents and explore the association of QoL with treatment response. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed using an online questionnaire to collect QoL data of children with ADHD (based on proxy reporting of parents) and their parents in a sample of members of an ADHD parent association. QoL was measured by EQ-5D and KIDSCREEN-10. Treatment response was based on descriptions by experts, based on compliance and functioning. RESULTS: Analyses were based on 618 questionnaires (treatment responder n=428, treatment non-responder n=190). Mean age of the children was 11.8 years (82.4% male). QoL according to EQ-5D utility was 0.83 and 0.74 for responders and non-responders, respectively (p<0.001). For KIDSCREEN-10 the index was 42.24 and 40.33 for responders and non-responders, respectively (p<0.001) EQ-5D utility scores of the parents were 0.83 on average; no association with their child's treatment response could be established. A significant positive correlation between EQ-5D utility of the children and EQ-5D utility of the parents (R2=0.207, p<0.001) was found. The association between treatment response and children's QoL was significantly influenced by age category, having a sibling with ADHD, and presence of comorbidity. DISCUSSION: Strengths of this study are its sample size and the inclusion of QoL of parents, which has not been reported simultaneously before. The facts that data were derived from members of the ADHD parent association, the data for children were based on parents' report, and lack of possibility for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis are the main study limitations. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND USE: QoL of children with ADHD was shown to be significantly positively associated with response to treatment and negatively affected by comorbidity. In determining the treatment effects in ADHD, QoL and family overall well-being should be a standard consideration as well as an integrated part of health policy discussions on ADHD IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: Policymakers in the field of ADHD should focus on QoL of the patient, but also on the broader effects of effective treatment on the well-being of the parents. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Suggestions for further research include the repetition of this study including a control group and obtaining children's self-report on QoL and clinicians report on diagnosis",na,1

11322,The quality of life impact of peripheral versus central vision loss with a focus on glaucoma versus age-related macular degeneration,age-related macular degeneration; cataracts; diabetic macular edema; glaucoma; quality of life; vision loss,"PURPOSE: It is well accepted that conditions that cause central vision loss (CVL) have a negative impact on functional ability and quality of life (QoL), but the impact of diseases that cause peripheral vision loss (PVL) is less well understood. Focusing on glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), the effects of CVL and PVL on QoL were compared. METHODS: A systematic literature review of publications reporting QoL in patients with CVL or PVL identified 87 publications using four generic (Short-Form Health Survey-36 and -12, EuroQoL EQ-5D and Sickness Impact Profile) and five vision-specific (National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-51, -39, and -25, Impact of Vision Impairment and Visual Function-14) QoL instruments; 33 and 15 publications reported QoL in ARMD and glaucoma, respectively. RESULTS: QoL was impaired to a similar extent by diseases associated with PVL and CVL, but different domains were affected. In contrast to ARMD, mental aspects appeared to be affected more than physical aspects in patients with glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: The differential impact upon QoL might be a function of the pathology of the diseases, for example potential for blindness and better ability to perform physical tasks due to retention of central vision may explain these observations in glaucoma",10.2147/opth.s6024,1

This study examines the stability of DCETTO to estimate health utility values from the five-level EQ-5D, an instrument with depicts 3125 different health states Between January and March 2011, we administered 120 DCETTO tasks based on the five-level EQ-5D to a total of 1799 respondents in the UK (each completed 15 DCETTO tasks on-line). We compared models across different sample sizes and different total numbers of observations. We found the DCETTO coefficients were generally consistent, with high agreement between individual ordinal preferences and aggregate cardinal values. Keeping the DCE design and the total number of observations fixed, subsamples consisting of 10 tasks per respondent with an intermediate sized sample, and 15 tasks with a smaller sample provide similar results in comparison to the whole sample model. In conclusion, we find that the DCETTO is a feasible method for developing values for larger descriptive systems such as EQ-5D-5L, and find evidence supporting important design features for future valuation studies that use the DCETTO",10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.05.026,0

METHODS: Patients with breast (n = 66), colorectal (n = 57), and lung (n = 61) cancer completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the FACT-G, as well as three generic instruments: the EQ-5D, the SF-6D, and the HUI2/3. Disease severity was quantified using cancer stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) score, and self-reported health status. Comparative analyses confirmed the multi-dimensional conceptualization of the instruments in terms of construct and convergent validity. RESULTS: In general, the instruments were able to discriminate across severity measures. The instruments demonstrated moderate to strong correlation with each other (r = 0.37-0.73). Not all of the measures could discriminate between different groups of disease severity: the EQ-5D and SF-6D were less discriminative than the HUI2/3 and the cancer-specific instruments. CONCLUSION: The cancer-specific and generic preference-based instruments demonstrated to be valid in discriminating across levels of ECOG-PS scores and self-reported health states. However, the usefulness of the generic instruments may be limited if they are not able to detect small changes in health status within cancer patients. This raises concerns regarding the appropriateness of these instruments when comparing different cancer treatments within an economic evaluation framework",10.1186/1477-7525-9-106,1

METHODS: The following outcomes were assessed in outpatients with advanced COPD (n = 105) or CHF (n = 80): clinical characteristics; general health status (EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D); Assessment of Quality of Life instrument (AQoL); Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)); disease-specific health status (St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ)); physical mobility (timed 'Up and Go' test); and care dependency (Care Dependency Scale). RESULTS: Patients with advanced COPD or CHF have an impaired health status and may be confronted with care dependency. Multiple regression analyses have shown that physical and psychological symptoms, care dependency and number of drugs were correlated with impaired health status in advanced COPD or CHF, while demographic and clinical characteristics like age, gender, disease severity and co-morbidities were not correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical care should regularly assess symptom burden and care dependency to identify patients with advanced COPD or CHF at risk for an impaired health status",10.1007/s11136-011-9892-9,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of PD patients who underwent DBS from 2007 to 2011, who had Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement subscale (CGI-I) scores at approximately one year postsurgery. We also analyzed a subgroup of patients who had pre and postoperative Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part II (functional subscale) and European Quality of Life Scale (EQ5D) scores. We performed regression analyses to determine the association between their median household income and their improvement in the MDS-UPDRS Part II, EQ-5D, and CGI-I post-DBS surgery. RESULTS: We analyzed 125 PD patients with CGI-I at one year post-DBS, including a subset of 43 patients who had pre- and post-DBS MDS-UPDRS Part II and EQ5D scores at 6 and 12 months Median income was not significantly associated with the one-year CGI-I, the six-month MDS-UPDRS II, and the six-month and one-year EQ5D score. However, after adjusting for preoperative MDS-UPDRS II score, for every $10,000 increase in household median income, there was a 2.15-point improvement on the MDS-UPDRS II score after one year (95% confidence interval = -3.63 to -0.66, p = 0.0060) CONCLUSIONS: PD patients with higher household incomes had better functional improvement at one year. However, this did not necessarily translate to better quality of life or overall clinical improvement when compared with PD patients with lower household incomes. The influence of household income on DBS and other advanced therapies for PD will need further investigation",10.1111/ner.12324,1

A series of national stroke audits in the UK highlighted the differences in stroke care between hospitals The study aims to describe variation in outcomes following stroke and to identify the characteristics of services that are associated with better outcomes, after accounting for case mix differences and individual prognostic factors METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a cohort study in eight acute NHS trusts within East of England, with at least one year of follow-up after stroke. The study population will be a systematically selected representative sample of patients admitted with stroke during the study period, recruited within each hospital. We will collect individual patient data on prognostic characteristics, health care received, outcomes and costs of care and we will also record relevant characteristics of each provider organisation. The determinants of one year outcome including patient reported outcome will be assessed statistically with proportional hazards regression models. Self (or proxy) completed EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaires will measure quality of life at baseline and follow-up for cost utility analyses. DISCUSSION: This study will provide observational data about health service factors associated with variations in patient outcomes and health care costs following hospital admission for acute stroke. This will form the basis for future RCTs by identifying promising health service interventions, assessing the feasibility of recruiting and following up trial patients, and provide evidence about frequency and variances in outcomes, and intra-cluster correlation of outcomes, for sample size calculations. The results will inform clinicians, public, service providers, commissioners and policy makers to drive further improvement in health services which will bring direct benefit to the patients",10.1186/1472-6963-11-50,0

METHODS: The intervention-participating subjects were randomized into three groups, including two intervention groups (support and telephone groups) and a usual care reference group. Intervention-nonparticipating subjects were concurrently enrolled Intervention effectiveness was assessed on the EQ-5D measure. The costs included direct healthcare cost from medical billing data, patient out-of-pocket expense, caregiver expense, patient loss-of-work cost, and intervention cost. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from societal, provider, and patient perspectives. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-seven intervention-participating and 69 intervention-nonparticipating post-cancer treatment patients were included. The support and telephone groups, but not the usual care group, had significantly higher EQ-5D index scores (0.054, p = 0.033, and 0.057, p = 0.026, respectively) than the intervention-nonparticipating group at month 6. Within 6 months, intervention cost per subject was $252 and $484, respectively, for providers, and $564 and $203, respectively, for the support and phone group subjects. The final ICERs were $16,759 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $12,561/QALY for support and telephone groups, compared with those of the intervention-nonparticipating group. These ICERs are much smaller than $50,000/QALY, the consensus threshold to determine cost-effectiveness for society. CONCLUSIONS: The study interventions are cost-effective in consideration of eligible patients who declined the interventions. The interventions can provide meaningful outcome improvement on urinary continence at a low cost. This evidence provides critical information for future health policy decision-making of healthcare providers and payers",10.1002/pon.3849,1

Long-term follow-ups after the surgical treatment of ACL injuries in adolescents are rare. PURPOSE: To evaluate results 10 to 20 years after ACL reconstruction in terms of the radiographic presence of osteoarthritis, clinical assessments, and health-related quality of life in patients who were adolescents at the time of surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Thirty-two adolescents (mean age, 15.2 years [range, 12-16 years]; 11 boys, 21 girls), with a symptomatic unilateral ACL rupture, underwent reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone (n=10) or hamstring tendon (n=22) autografts at an almost skeletally mature age according to Tanner stage 4 Twenty-nine patients (91%) underwent clinical, radiographic, and health-related quality of life assessments after 10 to 20 years (mean, 175 months). RESULTS: The mean time between the injury and index surgery was 11.6 months. The reconstructed knee had significantly more osteoarthritic changes compared with the noninvolved contralateral knee (P=.001). Preoperatively, the median Tegner activity level was 4 (range, 2-8), and the median Lysholm knee score was 75 (range, 50-90) points At follow-up, the respective median values were 4 (range, 1-7) and 84 (range, 34-100) points (P=not significant [preoperatively vs follow-up]). The median finding for the single-legged hop test was 84% (range, 0%-105%) preoperatively and 93% (range, 53%-126%) at follow-up (P=.01). At follow-up, muscle strength measurements displayed more than 90% of the noninvolved leg in both extension and flexion. The manual Lachman test result was significantly improved at follow-up compared with preoperatively (P<.001). The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) revealed scores comparable with those of healthy controls. The mean EuroQol (EQ-5D) score was 0.86±0.12. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) values were lower in all dimensions compared with age-matched healthy controls. CONCLUSION: In the long term, patients who were adolescents at the time of ACL reconstruction revealed significantly more radiographically visible osteoarthritic changes in their operated knee than in their noninvolved contralateral knee. Clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life are comparable with those of healthy controls",10.1177/0363546514555673,1

During the last years outcome parameters have been developed to evaluate different aspects of the disease Among these are the Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI), numeric rating scales for general pain, night pain, patients and physicians global assessment, as well as questionnaires to evaluate quality of life as the short Form (SF)- 36, Euroquol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), or the AS specific the ASQuol. These outcome parameters are the basis to conduct clinical trials. The ASessements in AS (ASAS) improvement criteria were developed to evaluate the short term efficacy of Non-Steroidal Antirheumatic Drugs (NSAIDs) and adjusted for the measurement of the high efficacy of the TNF-alpha blocking agents. To examine the x-rays of sacroiliac joints (SIG), the radiological criteria as part of the modified New York criteria are mostly used. For the x-rays of the spine the Bath AS Radiology Index (BASRI) is valuable in daily practice, but the modified Stokes AS Spine Score (mSASSS) is more sensitive for clinical trials. To examine Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of SIG and spine also scores are currently developed. Altogether, using the new outcome parameters it was possible to demonstrate the strikingly high efficacy of theTNF-alpha blocking agents. However, it could also be shown that conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are not effective in the treatment of the axial forms of SpA",10.1007/s00393-006-0038-3,0
12861,Using QALYs in telehealth evaluations: a systematic review of methodology and transparency,Humans; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Telemedicine/economics/standards,"BACKGROUND: The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a recognised outcome measure in health economic evaluations. QALY incorporates individual preferences and identifies health gains by combining mortality and morbidity into one single index number. A literature review was conducted to examine and discuss the use of QALYs to measure outcomes in telehealth evaluations. METHODS: Evaluations were identified via a literature search in all relevant databases. Only economic evaluations measuring both costs and QALYs using primary patient level data of two or more alternatives were included. RESULTS: A total of 17 economic evaluations estimating QALYs were identified. All evaluations used validated generic health related-quality of life (HRQoL) instruments to describe health states. They used accepted methods for transforming the quality scores into utility values. The methodology used varied between the evaluations. The evaluations used four different preference measures (EQ-5D, SF-6D, QWB and HUI3), and utility scores were elicited from the general population. Most studies reported the methodology used in calculating QALYs. The evaluations were less transparent in reporting utility weights at different time points and variability around utilities and QALYs. Few made adjustments for differences in baseline utilities. The QALYs gained in the reviewed evaluations varied from 0.001 to 0.118 in implying a small but positive effect of telehealth intervention on patient's health. The evaluations reported mixed cost-effectiveness results CONCLUSION: The use of QALYs in telehealth evaluations has increased over the last few years. Different methodologies and utility measures have been used to calculate QALYs. A more harmonised methodology and utility measure is needed to ensure comparability across telehealth evaluations",10.1186/1472-6963-14-332,0

The subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive supervised naltrexone, acamprosate or disulfiram, plus a brief manual-based cognitive behavioral intervention (CBT). RESULTS: All three study groups showed a significant reduction in drinking from baseline to the end of the study. In the QL test EQ-5D, patients exhibited significant positive changes in sleeping, action, pain and mood dimensions. Severity of depression decreased during the whole study. Smoking decreased more in the disulfiram group than in the naltrexone and acamprosate groups. CONCLUSION: A combination of medical treatment (naltrexone, acamprosate or disulfiram) with the CBT-booklet (patient guide) appears to help reduce patients' symptoms of depression and improve their QL Treatment is also associated with success at quitting smoking, especially among patients using disulfiram",10.1093/alcalc/agt053,1

Opposing pathways between antipsychotic medication compliance and quality of life,Adult; Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychopathology; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Schizophrenia/drug therapy; Schizophrenic Psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires,"BACKGROUND: Non-compliance with medication often has long-term detrimental effects in patients with schizophrenia. However, when patients are compliant, it is not certain whether they experience short-term improved quality of life. By simultaneously reducing symptoms and increasing side-effects, compliance with antipsychotics may have opposing effects on a patient's perceived quality of life. AIM: This study aimed to identify any clinical-empirical evidence for two pathways between compliance and quality of life. METHOD: To evaluate various pathways between compliance (Service Engagement Scale plus a one-item rating), psychotic symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale), adverse medication effects (Subjective Wellbeing under Neuroleptics scale), and quality of life (EQ-5D), we used Structural Equation Modeling on cross-sectional data of 114 patients with a psychotic disorder. RESULTS: Compliance was not directly related to quality of life (r=0.004). The best-fitting model (chi(2)=1.08; df=1) indicated that high compliance was associated with fewer psychotic symptoms (beta=-0.23) and more adverse medication effects (beta=0.22). Symptoms (beta=-0.17) and adverse medication effects (beta=-0.48) were both related to lower quality of life. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that compliance with antipsychotics has two opposing pathways towards quality of life, albeit indirect ones. While compliance was associated with less severe psychotic symptoms, and was thus related to higher quality of life, it was also associated with more adverse medication effects, and was thus related to lower quality of life However, due to our study design, we cannot draw firm conclusions on causality Two possible clinical implications of the results for compliance and interventions are discussed",10.1016/j.schres.2009.05.022,0

In the meantime, repeated reports on high rates of adjacent vertebral fractures (ASF) after BKP of vertebral insufficiency fractures were published. The causes for ASF and their risk factors are still under debate. The purpose of this study was to report the incidence and potential risk factors of ASF within the SSR dataset. METHODS: The SSR data points are collected perioperatively and during follow-ups, with surgeon- and patient-based information. All patients documented with a monosegmental osteoporotic vertebral insufficiency fracture between March 2005 and May 2012 were included in the study. The incidence of ASF, significant associations with co-variates (patient age, gender, fracture location, cement volume, preoperative segmental kyphosis, extent of kyphosis correction, and individual co-morbidities) and influence on quality of life (EQ-5D) and back pain (VAS) were analyzed RESULTS: A total of 375 patients with a mean follow-up of 3.6 months was included. ASF were found in 9.9 % (n = 37) and occurred on average 2.8 months postoperatively. Preoperative segmental kyphosis >30° (p = 0.026), and rheumatoid arthritis (p = 0.038) and cardiovascular disease (p = 0.047) were significantly associated with ASF. Furthermore, patients with ASF had significantly higher back pain at the final follow-up (p = 0.001). No further significant associations between the studied co-variates and ASF were seen in the adjusted analysis CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that patients with a preoperative segmental kyphosis >30° or patients with co-morbidities like rheumatoid arthritis and a cardiovascular disease are at high risk of ASF within 6 months after the index surgery. In case of an ASF event, back pain levels are significantly increased LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV",10.1007/s00586-013-3052-6,1

However, the current literature mainly consists of retrospective single-centre (evidence class III) studies. This leads to a wide variability of technical approaches and clinical outcomes. To improve our knowledge about the key elements of cranioplasty, which may help optimising clinical treatment and long-term outcome, a prospective multicentre registry across Germany, Austria and Switzerland will be established. METHODS: All patients undergoing cranioplastic surgery in participating centres will be invited to join the registry. Technical methods, materials, medical history, adverse events and clinical outcome measures, including modified Rankin scale and EQ-5D, will be assessed at several time points. Patients will be accessible to inclusion either at initial decompressive surgery or when cranioplasty is planned. Scheduled monitoring will be carried out at time of inclusion and subsequently at time of discharge, if any readmission is necessary, and at follow-up presentation. Cosmetic results and patient satisfaction will also be assessed. Collected data will be managed and statistically analysed by an independent biometric institute. The primary endpoint will be mortality, need for operative revision and neurological status at 3 months following cranioplasty ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained at all participating centres. The registry will provide reliable prospective evidence on surgical techniques, used materials, adverse events and functional outcome, to optimise patient treatment. We expect this study to give new insights in the treatment of skull defects and to provide a basis for future evidence-based therapy regarding cranioplastic surgery.

METHODS: We gathered all HAVS cases diagnosed at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki and Tampere during 1990-2008. A questionnaire was sent to all these patients (n = 241). Altogether 149 of them (62 %) returned the questionnaire Cumulative lifelong vibration exposure was evaluated on the basis of the data in the patient files. RESULTS: On average, 8.5 years after the diagnosis of HAVS, approximately one-third of the patients reported improvement in symptoms of vibration-induced white finger (VWF) and the sensorineural symptoms. Young age and shorter exposure time were associated with improvement in VWF symptoms (p = 0.033 and p < 0.001, respectively). Persistent or deteriorated symptoms of both VWF and sensorineural symptoms were associated with lowered work ability, quality of life (EQ-5D), and general health, also after adjusting for age, smoking, and diseases other than HAVS. The patients' own prediction of work ability in 2 years was more negative if the VWF symptoms or sensorineural symptoms had continued after diagnosis of HAVS (p = 0.065 and p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in about two-thirds of the patients, the HAVS symptoms may stabilize or deteriorate in the follow-up. Considering the effects on work ability, timely prevention measures should be taken more actively to help patients continue their working careers",10.1007/s00420-015-1034-1,1

Limited data from the patients' perspective are available on the use of biologics in the treatment of these chronic conditions and this evaluation was designed to collect data from patients who had been prescribed etanercept for the first time. This manuscript describes the self-reported baseline characteristics and health-related quality of life of patients prior to treatment. Follow-up data will be reported separately. METHODS: Patients throughout the United Kingdom prescribed etanercept were invited to participate in an evaluation of their condition and treatment using a data collection tool consisting of a web-based system supplemented by telephone reporting (PROBE) Outcome measures reported at baseline included demographic data, the condition being treated, previous treatment with biologic agents and current and previous medications. Questions modified from standard, validated quality of life questionnaires such as EQ-5D were incorporated and patients made a global assessment of the severity of their own illness using the CGI-S scale. RESULTS: A total of 344 patients/carers/parents participated in the evaluation at baseline, 290 (84%) by online questionnaire and 54 (16%) by telephone. Overall, the study population had a mean age of 53 years, was predominantly female (62%) and 20% had been previously treated with a biologic agent. A total of 191 (56%) patients were receiving treatment with etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis, 44 (13%) for psoriatic arthritis, 43 (13%) for ankylosing spondylitis, 35 (10%) for psoriasis, 9 (3%) for known juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 22 (6%) for another condition/patient unsure/missing response. All patients were prescribed the 50 mg weekly dose of etanercept except for 1 patient with JIA (40 mg) dose and 2 patients with psoriasis (100 mg). Thirty-eight percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis were not receiving treatment with methotrexate. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline characteristics and health-related quality of life of first time users of etanercept can be adequately described using self-reported patient data collected using an online questionnaire with a telephone option (PROBE)",10.1186/1471-2288-11-91,1
13925,Cost-effectiveness of collaborative care including PST and an antidepressant treatment algorithm for the treatment of major depressive disorder in primary care; a randomised clinical trial,"Algorithms; Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use; Comorbidity; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/drug therapy/therapy; Humans; Netherlands; Primary Health Care/economics/methods; Problem Solving","BACKGROUND: Depressive disorder is currently one of the most burdensome disorders worldwide. Evidence-based treatments for depressive disorder are already available, but these are used insufficiently, and with less positive results than possible. Earlier research in the USA has shown good results in the treatment of depressive disorder based on a collaborative care approach with Problem Solving Treatment and an antidepressant treatment algorithm, and research in the UK has also shown good results with Problem Solving Treatment. These treatment strategies may also work very well in the Netherlands too, even though health care systems differ between countries. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a two-armed randomised clinical trial, with randomization on patient-level. The aim of the trial is to evaluate the treatment of depressive disorder in primary care in the Netherlands by means of an adapted collaborative care framework, including contracting and adherence-improving strategies, combined with Problem Solving Treatment and antidepressant medication according to a treatment algorithm. Forty general practices will be randomised to either the intervention group or the control group. Included will be patients who are diagnosed with moderate to severe depression, based on DSM-IV criteria, and stratified according to comorbid chronic physical illness. Patients in the intervention group will receive treatment based on the collaborative care approach, and patients in the control group will receive care as usual. Baseline measurements and follow up measures (3, 6, 9 and 12 months) are assessed using questionnaires and an interview. The primary outcome measure is severity of depressive symptoms, according to the PHQ9. Secondary outcome measures are remission as measured with the PHQ9 and the IDS-SR, and cost-effectiveness measured with the TiC-P, the EQ-5D and the SF-36 DISCUSSION: In this study, an American model to enhance care for patients with a depressive disorder, the collaborative care model, will be evaluated for effectiveness in the primary care setting. If effective across the Atlantic and across different health care systems, it is also likely to be an effective strategy to implement in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the Netherlands",10.1186/1472-6963-7-34,0

The type of dressing applied after initial debridement could potentially affect this risk. In this trial, standard dressings will be compared with a new emerging treatment, negative pressure wound therapy, for patients with open lower limb fractures. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All adult patients presenting with an open lower limb fracture, with a Gustilo and Anderson (G&A) grade 2/3, will be considered for inclusion. 460 consented patients will provide 90% power to detect a difference of eight points in the Disability Rating Index (DRI) score at 12 months, at the 5% level. A randomisation sequence, stratified by trial centre and G&A grade, will be produced and administered by a secure web-based service. A qualitative substudy will assess patients' experience of giving consent for the trial, and acceptability of trial procedures to patients and staff. Patients will have clinical follow-up in a fracture clinic up to a minimum of 12 months as per standard National Health Service (NHS) practice Functional and quality of life outcome data will be collected using the DRI, SF12 and EQ-5D questionnaires at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postoperatively. In addition, information will be requested with regards to resource use and any late complications or surgical interventions related to their injury. The main analysis will investigate differences in the DRI score at 1 year after injury, between the two treatment groups on an intention-to-treat basis. Tests will be two sided and considered to provide evidence for a significant difference if p values are less than 0.05. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was given by NRES Committee West Midlands-Coventry & Warwickshire on 6/2/2012 (ref: 12/WM/0001). The results of the trial will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and presentations at relevant conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN33756652",10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009087,0

A self-administered questionnaire with both measures was used in 59 outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the findings compared with standard gamble (SG) and time trade-off (TTO) utilities, spirometry and arterial blood gases. Quality of life scores were smallest for EQ-TTO (median 0.73) and highest for SG and TTO (median 0.91 and 0.95 respectively), while 15D gave intermediate values (median 0.80). The test-retest reliability over 14 days was: 15D (p = 0.90) and EQ-TTO (p = 0.73), using Spearman's rank correlation. 15D was better than EQ-TTO at discriminating between groups of patients after reported global rating of change over 12 months (P = 0.004 versus P = 0.09), indicating that 15D was more responsive. The 15D instrument has many attractive properties when compared to the EQ-TTO method, including a better reliability and responsiveness. Validity depends on validation method. The findings in this study indicate that the different utility measures measure different aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Caution should be taken when choosing utility instruments in cost-utility studies, as this can strongly influence the results",10.1023/a:1026475531996,1

A variety of interventions that aim to improve client outcomes have been studied, but to date, there is limited translational research that examines the efficacy of moving such interventions from clinical trials to agency settings. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate a restorative occupational therapy intervention relative to ""usual care"" among community-dwelling older adults. The intervention included a detailed assessment from a person-environment perspective and provision of adaptive equipment and home modifications where appropriate. The intervention (n = 31) and control groups (n = 29) were evaluated at 3 months and assessed for changes in functional status, home safety, falls, health-related quality of life (HRQoL; EQ5D), depression, social support, and fear of falling; a 4 subgroup analysis also examined outcomes by waiting list status. An informal economic evaluation compared the intervention to usual care. RESULTS: Findings indicated improvements in home safety (p < .0005, b = -15.87), HRQoL (p = .03, b = 0.08), and fear of falling (p < .05, b = 2.22). Findings did not show improvement in functional status or reduction in actual falls. The intervention resulted in a 39% reduction in recommended hours of personal care, which if implemented, could result in significant cost savings. IMPLICATIONS: The study adds to the growing literature of occupational therapy interventions for older adults, and the findings support the concept that restorative approaches can be successfully implemented in public agencies",10.1093/geront/gns145,1

OBJECTIVE: To assess PROs in Canadian patients with moderate to severe psoriasis receiving etanercept in an open-label trial more representative of general clinical practice than traditional research studies. METHODS: This 1-year, multicenter, single-arm study enrolled 246 patients. Patients received etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 months and then 50 mg once weekly for 9 months. Primary and safety end points were reported previously Change from baseline to month 12 for the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), EuroQoL-5D, and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) are secondary outcomes reported here. Post hoc analyses of PROs are also reported RESULTS: Mean ± standard deviation (SD) DLQI total score improved from 13.7 ± 6.1 at baseline to 3.9 ± 5.6 at month 12. By month 12, 75% of patients achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in the DLQI (≥ 5-point improvement or a score of 0). Fifty-three to 86% of patients reported improvement or complete improvement in the six DLQI subscales. The mean ± SD EuroQoL-5D total score improved from baseline (0.67 ± 0.25) to month 12 (0.83 ± 0.25). The TSQM scores showed improvement in global satisfaction, effectiveness, and convenience after 3 months.

Results of the non-interventional study CORAL (COmpliance with RALoxifene)],"Bone Density Conservation Agents/therapeutic use; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal/drug therapy; Patient Compliance; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Raloxifene Hydrochloride/therapeutic use; Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/therapeutic use; Surveys and Questionnaires","Osteoporosis is a disease causing higher bone fragility and bone ruptures occurring even in minimal traumas. Good patient compliance is the prerequisite for long-term efficacy of osteoporosis treatment. Compliance data from randomised clinical studies may not provide reliable information about compliance in clinical practice which is usually lower. CORAL (COmpliance with RALoxifene therapy) is a local, Slovak, non-interventional, open, prospective, uncontrolled and multicentre study of woman patients on raloxifen therapy in current clinical practice. Raloxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) indicated for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the study was to assess compliance with raloxifen therapy in the conditions of current clinical practice. The secondary objectives were the assessment of the impact of therapy on the quality of life, of treatment satisfaction and treatment safety. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1497 patients with proven postmenopausal osteoporosis were enrolled in the 18-month study performed in 40 centres. Compliance was evaluated on the basis of the number of omissions in the use of the evaluated drug. Treatment satisfaction was evaluated by the patients who used a 0-100 visual analogue scale (VAS). Quality of life was evaluated by means of an EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire. In order to measure treatment safety, all adverse events were recorded by the supervising physician in a dedicated questionnaire at every visit. Statistical methods used: The non-parametrical Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the relation between raloxifen treatment compliance and the selected parametres (quality of life, treatment satisfaction, changes in health condition, premature discontinuation of therapy). The maximum likelihood ratio chi2 test and Fisher's exact test (for 2 x 2 tables) were used to analyse the ratio between compliance and reasons for enrolment in the study. Changes in treatment satisfaction in the course of the study were analysed using the Wilcoxon test. All the used tests were bilateral and data was assessed at a 5 % level of significance. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients enrolled in the study was 63.4 +/- 8.0 years. 58 % of patients were enrolled on the basis ofdensitometric evidence of osteoporosis, 74% of patients were enrolled for proven osteoporosis which had been manifested by a fracture, and osteoporotic fracture as such was the reason to start therapy in 10 % of patients. The majority of patients enrolled in the study (77%) had natural menopause. The mean period from menopause to the study was 15 years. Acceptable cooperation (> or =80% of medication used) was recorded for more than 90% of patients during the study, and total dosing adherence was recorded more than 58 % of patients. A significantly higher satisfaction with pharmacotherapy was observed in the patients who adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule. Adherence to the prescribed dosing schedule was also associated with a considerable better health condition and a higher quality of life. In a total of 1,497 evaluated patients, treatment was prematurely discontinued in 87 (5.8 %) women. The attending physician's decision, adverse events or the patient's request were relatively evenly distributed among the reasons for the discontinuation of therapy. Premature discontinuation of therapy was mostly recorded in patients who were not satisfied with the pharmacotherapy of osteoporosis as such, in women who were less satisfied with their overall health condition and who had a lower quality of life. DISCUSSION: The study showed very good patient compliance with raloxifen. The above findings associate with a significant correlation between the degree of adherence to therapy, treatment satisfaction and the overall health condition and quality of life. Premature discontinuation of therapy was observed in a very low number of women. It can be concluded that raloxifen therapy provides effective treatment of osteoporosis based on long-term cooperation of patients. CONCLUSION: Effective treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis with raloxifen is related to excellent cooperation of patients on a long-term basis",na,0

The objective of this cross-sectional survey (ANIMO study) was to examine the contribution of apathy to HRQOL in a Spanish sample of recently diagnosed PD patients. PD patients, diagnosed within 2 years of inclusion, were recruited at 102 outpatient clinics in 82 communities throughout Spain. Apathy was quantified using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale and HRQOL with the EuroQol-5D questionnaire A mean EuroQol-5D index score of 0.89 obtained from population references in Spain was used as the cutoff for this study. The relationship between apathy and the dichotomized EuroQol-5D index score (<0.89 [lower HRQOL] vs ≥0.89 [reference]) was examined using multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables. We consecutively recruited 557 patients (60.3% men) with a mean age of 68.8 ± 9.7 years. Apathy was diagnosed in 291 (52.2%) and was related to problems in each of the EuroQoL dimensions Apathetic PD patients showed EuroQol-5D index scores significantly lower than those without apathy (0.64 vs 0.83). In an adjusted model, apathetic PD patients were 2.49 times more likely to have lower HRQOL than nonapathetic patients (odds ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-4.15, P < 0.01). Apathy is very common in those with recently diagnosed PD and is one of the major clinical determinants of HRQOL in this disease. It should be one of the primary concerns among clinicians who provide treatment to individuals affected by PD",10.1002/mds.23872,1

METHODS: Momentary HRQOL was examined with the experience sampling method (ESM) in 139 participants from four different samples. The ESM consists of a so-called beep questionnaire that was administered 10 times a day by an electronic device. Feasibility was determined by assessing willingness to participate in the study and by analyzing the percentage of dropouts and the number of completed beep questionnaires. Multilevel analysis was used to investigate the relation between momentary HRQOL and momentary feelings and symptoms. The relation between momentary outcomes and the EuroQol visual analogue scale was investigated with a multiple regression model. RESULTS: The overall participation rate was low, but there were no dropouts and the number of completed beeps was comparable to that in other studies. Multilevel analysis showed that feelings and symptoms were significant predictors of momentary HRQOL The strength of these relations differed among three patient groups and a population-based sample. The EuroQol visual analogue scale was not predicted by momentary feelings and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that the use of the ESM to measure accounts of the momentary experience of health in different populations is feasible. Retrospective measures may provide a biased account of the impact of health problems in the daily lives of people who are affected Moreover, the bias may be different in different conditions",10.1016/j.jval.2014.10.003,0

The procedures include labral repair or biceps tenodesis. Retrospective cohort studies have suggested that the benefits of tenodesis include pain relief and improved function, and higher patient satisfaction, which was reported in a prospective non-randomised study. There have been no completed randomised controlled trials of surgery for type II SLAP lesions. The aims of this participant and observer blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial are to compare the short-term (6 months) and long-term (2 years) efficacy of labral repair, biceps tenodesis, and placebo (diagnostic arthroscopy) for alleviating pain and improving function for type II SLAP lesions. METHODS/DESIGN: A double-blind randomised controlled trial are performed using 120 patients, aged 18 to 60 years, with a history for type II SLAP lesions and clinical signs suggesting type II SLAP lesion, which were documented by MR arthrography and arthroscopy. Exclusion criteria include patients who have previously undergone operations for SLAP lesions or recurrent shoulder dislocations, and ruptures of the rotator cuff or biceps tendon Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, three, six, 12, and 24 months.

METHODS: A multicentre, cross-sectional, observation study was performed. The location of the arthritis (presence/absence) was recorded. Disability was measured using the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index and the QoL determined using the EQ-5D-3 Level questionnaire. The relationship between the arthritis, disability, and the QoL was evaluated using the structural equation model (SEM). PATIENTS: 965 patients with arthritis (mean age=64 years, with 75% females). Arthritis: mean areas affected: 2.8. Areas most frequently affected: knees (67%); lumbar spine (60%) and cervical spine (45%). QoL: The majority of patients did not mention serious problems in the five domains assessed. Disability: «other activities» (mean=1.2); «reach» (mean=1.1) and «walking» (mean=1.0) were the categories that demonstrated greater disability. The SEM showed arthritis, disability and QoL as associated latent variables. Although 92% of the QoL explained the disability, only 5% of the disability was due to the presence/absence of arthritis. The global model that describes arthritis as a cause of disability, and disability was affecting the QoL, had a reasonable goodness of fit (CMIN/DF=5.42; RMR=0.026; RMSEA=0.069). CONCLUSIONS: Functional disability can explain the decrease in QoL. In theory, arthritis is closely related with disability and QoL, but the model did not mange to fully explain this link. As statistical techniques required good measurement models to correctly determine relationships, conventional medical records seem to be insufficient for this purpose. Other valid measurements of arthritis are needed to provide tests of its direct effect on disability and QoL",10.1016/j.recot.2012.01.001,0

SUMMARY ANSWER: Although EHP-5 and EQ-5D instruments had an excellent responsiveness, EHP-5 has a better discriminative ability than EQ-5 to measure health-related quality of life (HrQoL). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Proper measurement of HrQoL is important in endometriosis. While many quality of life instruments are available, few have been completely validated in endometriosis. The EHP-5 and the EQ-5D are short and practical scales, which may be useful. Literature is lacking to determine which one is the most suitable in clinical practice or in clinical research. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective and observational study conducted between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013 included a total of 253 consecutive women with proven endometriosis, undergoing medical or surgical treatment, in 2 French tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: Women over 18 years consulting for painful symptoms of at least 3 months' duration or for infertility, with endometriosis proven histologically or radiologically, were requested to fill in the 2 scales before (T0) and 12 months after treatment (T1) Construct validity consisted in testing presupposed relationships between the scales and the characteristics of the patients or the endometriosis Responsiveness to change was calculated for all patients and in each treatment group. Effect sizes were used according to Cohen's d method. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 216 women filled in completely all the questionnaires at T0 and 133 (61.6%) at T1. EHP-5 and EQ-5D had good discriminative abilities regarding the patients' symptoms, with significant superiority of EHP-5 concerning three of the nine hypotheses. The largest difference was that calculated for the 'intensity of dysmenorrhea' using the Visual Analogic Scale, with respectively effect size from Cohen's d (ES) = 0.86 95% CI (0.54-1.17) for EHP-5 versus 0.48 95% CI (0.16-0.79) for EQ-5D. There were no differences in EHP-5 or in EQ-5D scores between subgroups according to the characteristics of endometriosis. Overall responsiveness was excellent and equivalent for EHP-5 and for EQ-5D, with, respectively, ES = 0.81 95% CI (0.56-1.56) versus ES = 0.95 95% CI (0.68-1.20). In subgroup analyses, EHP-5 was responsive in case of medical treatment with ES = 0.93 95% CI (0.07-1.70), whereas EQ-5D was not, ES = 0.73 95% CI (-0.06-1.47). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our study population included patients with symptomatic and mainly severe forms of endometriosis, which may suggest a spectrum bias. The evaluation of responsiveness in case of medical treatment was based on a small number of patients, which limits the interpretation of the difference found between the two scales in this subgroup WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: EHP-5 is a simple, efficient and valid tool for evaluating quality of life in daily practice and also valuable to provide a primary outcome in clinical studies evaluating treatment efficacy.

114,Adding a fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L improves its psychometric performance in the general population,Bolt-on; EQ-5D; Fatigue; General population; Health-related quality of life,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and often disturbing sequela of serious chronic health conditions. In the widely applied HRQL instrument, the EQ-5D, this aspect is not included directly, for its assumed lack of additional information. We investigated the validity of this assumption by determining the gain-if any-of an additional fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L in a general population sample. METHODS: A Dutch general population sample (including diseased people) completed a web-based survey including the EQ-5D-5L and the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ). The RPQ fatigue item was used to create the EQ-5D-5L + Fatigue. We head-to-head compared the psychometric performance contrasting the EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-5L + Fatigue: distribution (e.g ceiling), informativity cf. Shannon's indices, convergent validity, domain dependency, and explanatory power. Results were compared between subgroups with and without ≥ 1 chronic health condition. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 3027 persons of whom 52% had a chronic health condition. The mean EQ-5D-5L utility score was 0.83 and 48% experienced some degree of fatigue. Adding the fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L decreased the ceiling effect, increased absolute informativity (H' = 6.44 vs. H' = 4.90) and relative informativity (J' = 0.46 vs J' = 0.42). The extra fatigue item slightly increased convergent validity (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = - 0.61 vs. - 0.62). Domain dependency analysis showed that all EQ-5D-5L domains are dominant over the fatigue item Explanatory power of the EQ-5D-5L + Fatigue was higher compared to the EQ-5D-5L (R(2) = 0.42 vs. 0.39). The gain is substantially larger in the subgroup with chronic health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L improved all psychometric performance criteria of the enriched instrument in the general population. Effects are substantially larger in the subgroup with chronic health conditions, indicating that adding a fatigue item to the EQ-5D-5L is especially relevant in evaluating the HRQL of diseased people",10.1186/s41687-021-00406-x,1

Secondary aims were to assess whether length of time on the waiting list influenced quality of life and rate of deferral of surgery. METHODS: During the study period (August and September 2020) 843 patients (THA n = 394, KA n = 449) from ten centres in the UK reported their EuroQol five dimension (EQ-5D) scores and completed a waiting list questionnaire (2020 group). Patient demographic details, procedure, and date when listed were recorded. Patients scoring less than zero for their EQ-5D score were defined to be in a health state ""worse than death"" (WTD). Data from a retrospective cohort (January 2014 to September 2017) were used as the control group. RESULTS: The 2020 group had a significantly worse EQ-5D score compared to the control group for both THA (p < 0.001) and KA (p < 0.001). Over one-third (35.0%, n = 138/394) of patients waiting for a THA and nearly a quarter (22.3%, n = 100/449) for KA were in a health state WTD, which was significantly greater than the control group (odds ratio 2.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.93) and 2.08 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.70), respectively; p < 0.001). Over 80% (n = 680/843) of the 2020 group felt that their quality of life had deteriorated while waiting. Each additional month spent on the waiting list was independently associated with a decrease in quality of life (EQ-5D: -0.0135, p = 0.004). There were 117 (13.9%) patients who wished to defer their surgery and the main reason for this was health concerns for themselves and or their family (99.1%, n = 116/117). CONCLUSION: Over one-third of patients waiting for THA and nearly one-quarter waiting for a KA were in a state WTD, which was approaching double that observed prior to the pandemic Increasing length of time on the waiting list was associated with decreasing quality of life.

340,Direct and Indirect Pathways for Health-Related Quality of Life Change from Pain Improvement in Neuropathic Pain Patients with Spine Diseases: Path Analysis with Structural Equation Modeling Using Non-Interventional Study Results of Pregabalin,EuroQoL 5 Dimensions; function; neuropathic pain; pregabalin; spine diseases; structural equation modeling,"BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain or chronic cervical pain often has a neuropathic pain (NeP) component and patients with these conditions complain of sleep deprivation, loss of physical function, and reduced productivity due to pain. The objective of this study was to clarify the pathway by which pain, sleep disturbance due to pain, and physical function status influence QOL measures in chronic low back pain patients with NeP associated with lumbar spine diseases (CLBP-NeP) and in chronic cervical pain patients with NeP associated with cervical spine diseases (CCP-NeP). METHODS: A model assuming pain numeric rating scale (NRS), pain-related sleep interference scale (PRSIS), and functional indices (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMDQ], Neck Disability index [NDI]) as factors that can affect outcomes such as QOL (calculated using EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)), the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) was developed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Overall trends were frequently observed in both patients with CLBP-NeP and CCP-NeP. Pain NRS had the largest comprehensive direct impact on QOL based on EQ-5D and an overall impression of changing symptoms. The effects of pain NRS on each outcome were largely due to direct pain-related effects; however, for EQ-5D, an indirect effect via functional improvement was the primary factor. CONCLUSION: Although the results of this study suggest that the indirect functional improvement of pain relief may not be recognized as a significant component of therapeutic effects by both physicians and patients, the pain-relieving intervention contributes directly to improvement of patients' overall QOL and also indirectly via functional improvement in Japanese primary care settings. Accordingly, to achieve the therapeutic goal for patients with NeP and minimize the impact of pain burden, our findings indicate that pain relief interventions are also crucial from the perspective of the patient's HRQOL",10.2147/JPR.S289396,0
527,Estimation of Health Utilities Based on the Response to Treatment in Atopic Dermatitis: a Population-based Study,"Adult; Dermatitis, Atopic/therapy; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; EQ-5D; atopic dermatitis; quality of life; time trade-off; utility weights; visual analog scale","PURPOSE: This study estimated utility weights based on the response to treatment for atopic dermatitis in the general population. METHODS: The Korean general population aged 20-60 years was stratified by using a random sampling method based on age and sex. Two hypothetical health states of atopic dermatitis were developed: response to treatment and no response to treatment. Health utility values were estimated by using time trade-off (TTO) based on a period of 10 years, TTO based on life expectancy, and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) including a visual analog scale (VAS). The mean utility value and 95% CI were derived, and comparisons of subgroups using the t test and ANOVA were performed. We conducted a multilevel analysis after controlling the sociodemographic variables to consider repeated measures. FINDINGS: A total of 155 participants were included in the survey. Their mean age was 39.7 years; 58.7% of participants were women The mean health utility values for response and no response using TTO based on 10 years were 0.847 and 0.380, respectively. The estimated health utility values of response and no response were 0.865 and 0.476 using TTO based on life expectancy, and 0.814 and 0.279 using EQ-5D. For VAS, the response and no response were 0.744 and 0.322. After controlling the covariates, the important factors that affected utility values were response and no response to treatment (P < 0.001) IMPLICATIONS: This study showed that the utility weights of people with no response to atopic dermatitis treatment were lower compared with response from the general population. Health care providers should therefore consider symptom control as an important factor affecting the quality of life of those with atopic dermatitis",10.1016/j.clinthera.2019.02.007,1
591,Examining the association between menstrual symptoms and health-related quality of life among working women in Japan using the EQ-5D,"Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Humans; Japan/epidemiology; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Women, Working; EQ-5D; EQ-5D-3L; Health economic evaluations; Health related quality of life (HRQoL); Japan; Menstrual symptoms; Menstruation; Quality of life (QoL); Utility values","BACKGROUND: Menstrual symptoms have been identified as a substantial burden among women of reproductive age, affecting their health status and quality of life globally. A range of menstrual symptoms have been studied as they affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), showing variations across specific menstrual symptoms and study settings. A major concern is demonstrated due to menstrual symptoms in women's professional and social life, and consequently societal and economic loss for women and the society at large. Yet evidence is scarce that estimates the index form HRQoL score related to menstrual symptoms that is needed for health economic evaluations. METHODS: This study aims to investigate the association between menstrual symptoms and the HRQoL among working women in Japan in an index form, using a self-reporting questionnaire (n = 6048). The EQ-5D-3L (EuroQoL 5-dimension 3-level) is used that is a widely used tool to measure health outcomes for health economic evaluations globally Multivariate regression analysis is conducted to assess the association between the HRQoL score and specific nineteen physical and mental conditions related to menstruation (e.g., pain, heavy bleeding, concentration, negative affect) RESULTS: The index form HRQoL score for menstrual symptoms is estimated as 0.682 in the study population (where a score one suggests perfect health). The association of the HRQoL score varies substantially across the menstrual symptoms. Several of the physical conditions and disorders show a substantial negative association with the HRQoL score. Also, most of the mental and psychological issues are significantly and negatively related to the HRQoL score CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that HRQoL is substantially and negatively affected by menstruation among working women in Japan. Distinct variations of negative influences across menstrual symptoms underscore the multi-dimensional nature of menstruation and consequently the need of collective interventions to address these difficulties. The evidence of HRQoL continues to be an important area for future research on women's health and health economic evaluations to inform effective and efficient resource allocations for relevant health policies and financing strategies",10.1186/s12905-021-01462-7,1
850,Estimating Informal Caregiving Time from Patient EQ-5D Data: The Informal CARE Effect (iCARE) Tool,"Caregivers/economics; Cost of Illness; Health Care Costs; Humans; Models, Econometric; Netherlands; Patient Care/economics; Quality of Life; Reimbursement Mechanisms; Surveys and Questionnaires","BACKGROUND: Families and friends provide a considerable proportion of care for patients and elderly people. Caregiving can have substantial effects on caregivers' lives, health, and well-being. However, because clinical trials rarely assess these effects, no information on caregiver burden is available when evaluating the cost effectiveness of treatments. OBJECTIVE: This study develops an algorithm for estimating caregiver time using information that is typically available in clinical trials: the EQ-5D scores of patients and their gender METHODS: Four datasets with a total of 8012 observations of dyads of caregivers and a gamma model with a log-link estimated with the Bayesian approach were used to estimate the statistical association between patient scores on the EQ-5D-3L dimensions and the numbers of hours of care provided by caregivers during the previous week. The model predicts hours of care as mean point estimates with 95% credible intervals or entire distributions. RESULTS: Model predictions of hours of care based on the five EQ-5D dimensions ranged from 13.06 (12.7-14.5) h/week for female patients reporting no health problems but receiving informal care to 52.82 (39.38-66.26) for male patients with the highest level of problems on all EQ-5D dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: The iCARE algorithm developed in this study allows researchers who only have patient-level EQ-5D data to estimate the mean hours of informal care received per week, including a 95% Bayesian credible interval Caregiver time can be multiplied with a monetary value for caregiving, enabling the inclusion of informal care costs in economic evaluations. We recommend using the tool for samples that fall within the confidence intervals of the characteristics of our samples: men (age range 47.0-104.2 years), women (age range 55-103 years)",10.1007/s40273-018-0706-6,1

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1378 participants were interviewed from July 2019 to March 2020 by 12 interviewers to select a representative sample in terms of: geographical distribution, age and gender, of which 75 participants did not complete the interview, 298 interviews were pilot and 1005 interviews were real of which 974 interviews were used for the valuation study. Two participants did not complete the country-specific questionnaire but completed the valuation protocol; therefore, 1301 interviews were included in the final analysis of country specific questions. RESULTS: Some modifications were applied to the protocol. The 'wheelchair example' was modified to 'migraine example' since most of the participants in the pilot interviews considered being in a wheelchair 'worse than dead'. There was some ambiguity in the Egyptian translated version for the EQ-5D-5L between levels 4 and 5 of the pain and depression dimensions This was overcome by using colour coding to express the different levels of severity. A pictorial representation for the EQ-5D-5L health states was used to interview illiterate and less educated participants. CONCLUSION: In the Egyptian valuation study, the modifications made to the EQ-VT protocol made it feasible and culturally acceptable to the Egyptian participants",10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051727,0

These long-term effects are unknown since most studies have a short follow-up. The aim of this study was to investigate self-assessed hip function, HRQoL and factors associated with 10-years mortality after a FNF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective multicenter study with a 10-year follow-up of patients aged 20-69 years with a displaced and non-displaced FNF treated with closed reduction and internal fixation. The self-administered questionnaires EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) and Hip Disability Outcome Score (HOOS) were used. Results of EQ-5D and HOOS was compared to sex and age matched general population data of Sweden. All patients that were deceased had their death date recorded. Factors associated with mortality were assessed by regression analysis of the baseline data including age, gender, harmful alcohol consumption according to AUDIT, co-morbidity measured by ASA-grade, body mass index, osteoporosis measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and smoking. Prevalence of co-morbidities and smoking was compared to general population data. RESULTS: From initial 182 included patients, 55 were deceased at 10-year follow-up, 4 were deregistered from public record and 35 declined participations. A total of 88 patients participated through self-administrated questionnaires. There were no significant differences in HOOS between gender and fracture type and the results were equivalent to general population data. The EQ-5D continued to improve compared to a 24-month follow-up (p = 0.006) but did not recover to pre-fracture level (p<0.001) though it was equivalent to general population data. Higher age, co-morbidity, osteoporosis and smoking were associated with increased mortality within 10 years after the fracture and the prevalence of co-morbidity and smoking was higher than the general population INTERPRETATION: Those patients who had survived 10 years after a FNF treated with CRIF had a HRQoL and hip function equivalent to age and sex matched general population of Sweden. However, a third of these relatively young patients had deceased 10 years after the hip fracture and they were more compromised than the general population",10.1016/j.injury.2020.06.029,1

No consensus system exists currently in the spine literature for the classification of these conditions postoperatively. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) in the assessment of dysphagia when compared with the Bazaz score. A secondary goal was to assess the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) scores among patients following ACDF. METHODS: Patients treated with ACDF (one, two, or three level) for cervical radiculopathy and/or cervical myelopathy at two tertiary hospitals were administered patient-reported outcome metrics preoperatively as well as at multiple time points postoperatively. The metrics administered included the EAT-10, VHI-10, Bazaz, Neck Disbability Index, and EuroQol Five Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)/visual analog scale. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included in this study. Eighty-nine percentage had a 1-year follow-up, and 100% had a 12-week follow-up. Mean Neck Disbability Index, EQ-5D, and EQ-visual analog scale scores all improved from baseline at both 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Both the EAT-10 and VHI-10 demonstrated excellent internal reliability (α = 0.95 and α = 0.90, respectively). Analysis of variance of EAT-10 and VHI-10 scores by time point demonstrated a statistically significant relationship (P < 0.0001). The EAT-10 and VHI-10 scores were statistically greater on postoperative day 1 than at all other times (Tukey posthoc, P < 0.0001 and P < 0.004, respectively) Across all time points, 176 instances of clinically significant dysphagia (EAT-10 ≥ 3) were noted, 57 (32%) of which were classified as ""None"" on the Bazaz classification. CONCLUSIONS: The EAT-10 score is an accurate measure for mild to severe dysphagia and better captured significant dysphagia that would have otherwise been missed when the Bazaz score is used. EAT-10 and VHI-10 are better measures of postoperative dysphagia and dysphonia than the current metrics used in spine surgery. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients",10.5435/JAAOS-D-17-00631,1

This study sought to compare utility weights of two popular MAUIs, the EQ-5D-3L and the SF-6D, and inform researchers in the selection of generic MAUI for use with cardiovascular (CVD) patients. METHODS: Data were collected in the Young@Heart study, a randomised controlled trial of a nurse-led multidisciplinary home-based intervention compared to standard usual care Participants (n = 598) completed the EQ-5D-3L and the SF-12v2, from which the SF-6D can be constructed, at baseline and at 24-month follow-up. This study examined discrimination, responsiveness, correlation and differences across the two instruments. RESULTS: Both MAUIs were able to discriminate between the NYHA severity classes and recorded similar changes between the two time points although only SF-6D differences were significant. Correlations between the dimensions of the two MAUIs were low. There were significant differences between the two instruments in mild conditions but they were similar in severe conditions. Substantial ceiling and floor effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the EQ-5D and the SF-6D cover different spaces in health due to their classification systems. Both measures were capable of discriminating between severity groups and responsive to quality of life changes in the follow-up. It is recommended to use the EQ-5D-3L in severe and the SF-6D in mild CVD conditions",10.1007/s11136-017-1666-6,1

The current study was performed to define and compare the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds in patients with and without preoperative diagnoses of anxiety or depression and obesity who underwent spinal fusion for grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis METHODS: The Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) was queried for patients who underwent lumbar fusion for grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis during the period from January 2014 to August 2017. Collected patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), health status (EQ-5D), and numeric rating scale (NRS) scores for back pain (NRS-BP) and leg pain (NRS-LP) Both anchor-based and distribution-based methods for MCID calculation were employed. RESULTS: Of 462 patients included in the prospective registry who underwent a decompression and fusion procedure, 356 patients (77.1%) had complete baseline and 12-month PRO data and were included in the study. The MCID values for ODI scores did not significantly differ in patients with and those without a preoperative diagnosis of obesity (20.58 and 20.69, respectively). In addition, the MCID values for ODI scores did not differ in patients with and without a preoperative diagnosis of anxiety or depression (24.72 and 22.56, respectively) Similarly, the threshold MCID values for NRS-BP, NRS-LP, and EQ-5D scores were not statistically different between all groups. Based on both anchor-based and distribution-based methods for determination of MCID thresholds, there were no statistically significant differences between all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: MCID thresholds were similar for ODI, EQ-5D, NRS-BP, and NRS-LP in patients with and without preoperative diagnoses of anxiety or depression and obesity undergoing spinal fusion for grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis. Preoperative clinical and shared decision-making may be improved by understanding that preoperative medical comorbidities may not affect the way patients experience and assess important clinical changes postoperatively",10.3171/2020.4.SPINE20296,1

The five-repetition sit-to-stand (5R-STS) test is a quick and objective tool that tests movements frequently used in everyday life. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the 5R-STS test in patients with degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine. METHODS: Patients and healthy volunteers completed the standardized 5R-STS, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analog scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, and EQ-5D for health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To assess convergent validity, the 5R-STS test times were correlated with these questionnaires. RESULTS: Overall, 157 patients and 80 volunteers were enrolled Direct correlation with RMDQ (r = 0.49), ODI (r = 0.44), and VAS for back pain (r = 0.31) and indirect correlation with the EQ-5D index (r = -0.41) were observed (p < 0.001). The 5R-STS test showed no correlation with VAS for leg pain and EQ-5D VAS (p > 0.05). In 119 individuals, the 5R-STS test demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.98. The upper limit of normal, distinguishing patients with and without objective functional impairment, was identified as 10.35 seconds. A severity stratification classified patients with test times of 10.5-15.2, 15.3-22.0, or greater than 22.0 seconds as having mild, moderate, or severe functional impairment, respectively CONCLUSIONS: The 5R-STS test is a simple and effective tool to describe objective functional impairment. A patient able to perform the test in 10.4 seconds can be considered to have no relevant objective functional impairment.

METHODS: Patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation were randomized to either a 12-week rehabilitation programme with education and physical training (intervention group) or standard care (control group). At baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months participants completed 5 different quality of life questionnaires (Quality of Life in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF-QoL-18), Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of Life (AFEQT), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) and EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D)), and physical exercise tests. Differences in mean] scores between groups were analysed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (age range 43-78 years, 31% female) were included. In the intervention group the AF-QoL-18 score increased from baseline (48.4 (standard deviation (SD) 22.8)) to 6 months (68.0 (SD 15.2)) compared with the control group (baseline 51.6 (SD 22.3), 6 months 59.2 (SD 27.3)). After 12 months, there was no difference. Similar patterns were found for the other questionnaires. Maximum exercise capacity improved in the intervention group from baseline (176 W (SD 48)) to 6 months (190 W (SD 55)). There was no change in the control group CONCLUSION: Education and physical training may have a short-term (but no long-term) beneficial effect on quality of life and physical exercise capacity in patients with atrial fibrillation",10.2340/16501977-2551,0

The emergence of smartphones facilitates passive sensor-based monitoring and active real-time monitoring through time-stamped prompts; however there are few validated self-report measures designed for this purpose. METHODS: We introduce a novel, compact questionnaire, Mood Zoom (MZ), embedded in a customised smart-phone application MZ asks participants to rate anxiety, elation, sadness, anger, irritability and energy on a 7-point Likert scale. For comparison, we used four standard clinical questionnaires administered to participants weekly to quantify mania (ASRM), depression (QIDS), anxiety (GAD-7), and quality of life (EQ-5D). We monitored 48 Bipolar Disorder (BD), 31 Borderline Personality Disorders (BPD) and 51 Healthy control (HC) participants to study longitudinal (median±iqr: 313±194 days) variation and differences of mood traits by exploring the data using diverse time-series tools. RESULTS: MZ correlated well (|R|>0.5,p<0.0001) with QIDS, GAD-7, and EQ-5D. We found statistically strong (|R|>0.3,p<0.0001) differences in variability in all questionnaires for the three cohorts. Compared to HC, BD and BPD participants exhibit different trends and variability, and on average had higher self-reported scores in mania, depression, and anxiety, and lower quality of life. In particular, analysis of MZ variability can differentiate BD and BPD which was not hitherto possible using the weekly questionnaires. LIMITATIONS: All reported scores rely on self-assessment; there is a lack of ongoing clinical assessment by experts to validate the findings. CONCLUSIONS: MZ could be used for efficient, long-term, effective daily monitoring of mood instability in clinical psychiatric practice",10.1016/j.jad.2016.06.065,0

Despite a significant number of medical approaches and the creation of new drugs, the effectiveness of treatment remains unsatisfactory, which necessitates the creation of complex treatment programs. Pulse low-frequency magnetotherapy is a modern method that makes it possible to potentiate the therapeutic effects of chondroprotectors for transdermal administration using magnetophoresis technology. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy using chondroprotective magnetophoresis using 'running' pulsed magnetic field (RPMF) and application of chondroxide (transdermal gel form) in patients with knee OA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial included 65 patients with grade II - III knee OA according to the Kellgren-Lwrence classification. The 1st group included 25 patients who received local therapy - chondroxide magnetophoresis using RPMF (20 mT, frequency 6.25 Hz, exposure time 20 min, No. 12); in the 2nd group - 20 patients who underwent placebo-magnetotherapy of chondroxide; in the 3rd group - 20 patients who used RPMF without local chondroprotective therapy. We used VAS, WOMAC scales, EQ-5D questionnaire, OMERACT-OARSI criterion in order to analyze the results. RESULTS: A pronounced analgesic effect of the treatment was registered (according to the VAS and WOMAC scales) in patients receiving magnetotherapy (p<0.01). A significant improvement in functional parameters (according to WOMAC) was noted, more pronounced in patients who used chondroxide magnetophoresis (p<0.001). During the course of treatment, a positive effect of magnetotherapy on the indicators of quality of life (according to EQ-5D) was registered. A high percentage of response (68.1%) to therapy using magnetophoresis of the transdermal form of chondroxide (according to OMERACT-OARSI) was demonstrated. No adverse reactions were registered during treatment. CONCLUSION: The use of the local therapy method in the form of magnetophoresis of the transdermal form of the chondroxide is an effective and safe treatment technology that improves the functional state and quality of life of patients with OA of the knee joint",10.17116/kurort20209701142,0
3383,Self-efficacy and Emotional Distress in a Cohort With Patellofemoral Pain,knee; patellofemoral pain; psychological; self-efficacy; widespread pain,"BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is commonly described and approached in biomechanical terms despite strong evidence that psychosocial factors such as kinesiophobia, emotional distress, and self-efficacy are important in long-standing musculoskeletal pain. PURPOSE: To describe levels of self-efficacy, emotional distress, kinesiophobia, and widespread pain in a cohort with long-standing PFP and determine their association with measures of pain, function, and health-related quality of life. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Included were 112 patients with PFP (age range, 16-40 years) who had been recruited to a randomized controlled trial Seven baseline factors (patient sex, pain duration, number of pain sites throughout the body, kinesiophobia [Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia], emotional distress [Hopkins Symptom Checklist], self-efficacy, and knee extension strength) were investigated for associations with the following outcomes: symptoms of PFP (Anterior Knee Pain Scale), pain (worst and usual), and health-related quality of life (5-level EuroQol-5 Dimensions [EQ-5D-5L]). We used bivariate models and multivariable linear regression models with a stepwise backward removal method to find associations with the outcomes. Internal validation was conducted, and adjusted coefficients after shrinkage are presented. RESULTS: Of the study patients, 28% reported emotional distress (Hopkins Symptom Checklist ≥1.75), 69% reported multiple pain sites, and 33% had widespread pain. The kinesiophobia score was elevated, with a mean score of 35.4 ± 8.2. Self-efficacy was strongly associated with better function (Anterior Knee Pain Scale) and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) as well as lower pain scores in bivariate and multivariable models. Self-efficacy and emotional distress explained 50% of the variance in health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). CONCLUSION: Our findings support other studies of PFP suggesting elevated levels of kinesiophobia and emotional distress and higher rates of widespread pain compared with the general population or pain-free controls. Higher self-efficacy was associated with better function and health-related quality of life. Together with emotional distress, it explained half the variance of health-related life quality. The results underline the importance of approaching these patients in a biopsychosocial model REGISTRATION: NCT02114294 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier)",10.1177/23259671221079672,0

Patient organisations across 47 countries were invited to voluntarily share the survey tool with their membership network. RESULTS: 767 responses from 38 countries showed that important QoL aspects were not captured by EQ-5D-5L for 51% of respondents, including fatigue (19%) and medication side effects (12%), among others. Fatigue (17%) was also the most commonly reported QoL aspect that changed over the course of patients' illness, suggesting that the current version of the EQ-5D-5L might miss capturing significant clinical changes in important QoL domains CONCLUSIONS: Utilisation of the EQ-5D-5L in HRQoL measurement raises inconsistencies in capturing QoL attributes and changes in disease-specific patient populations. Further research is needed to clarify the extent to which other generic HRQoL measurement tools capture the aspects of health that really matter for patients",10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.12.003,0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients with human papillomavirus-associated OPSCC treated at the Head and Neck Center at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were recruited to a prospective registry study between 2014 and 2016 and completed the core, head and neck-specific, and symptom interference sections of the MD Anderson symptom inventory (MDASI) multi-symptom questionnaire and the EQ-5D health status assessment as a measure of QOL at four time points. RESULTS: Longitudinal improvements from post-treatment nadir were observed across all groups. For patients treated with single modality, symptom interference, but not core and head and neck specific, MDASI scores were significantly better at 6 months in patients treated with surgery than radiation (P = 0.04). For patients treated with multiple modalities, scores for each of the three domains (i.e., core, head and neck -specific, and interference MDASI) were significantly better in the surgical group than the nonsurgical group at treatment completion (P = 0.0003, P = 0.0006 and P = 0.02) and 6 weeks (P = 0.001, P = 0.05 and P = 0.04), but not 6 months (P = 0.11, P = 0.16 and P = 0.040). No significant differences in EQ5D health status were observed between groups at any time point, reflecting similar overall QOL in all groups. CONCLUSION: Symptom burden and QOL improves after treatment in OPSCC survivors over time regardless of whether primary surgical or nonsurgical treatment is used, although acute symptom profiles may differ",10.1016/j.oraloncology.2019.01.020,1
4210,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Comprehensive Smoking-Cessation Interventions Based on the Community and Hospital Collaboration,Cost-Benefit Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Smoking/epidemiology; Smoking Cessation/methods; community health centers; cost-effectiveness; online health promotion; pharmacological intervention; smoking cessation,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of cigarette smoking in China is high and the utilization of smoking cessation clinics is very low. Multicomponent smoking cessation interventions involving community and hospital collaboration have the potential to increase the smoking cessation rate. However, the cost-effectiveness of this intervention model is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a smoking cessation intervention trial in 19 community health service centers in Beijing, China. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal perspective to compare three strategies of smoking cessation: no intervention (NI), pharmacological intervention (PI), and comprehensive intervention (CI) (PI plus online health promotion). A Markov model, with a time horizon of 20 years, was used to simulate the natural progression of estimated 10,000 male smokers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to obtain data on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by using the five-level EuroQol-5-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to explore parameters of uncertainty in the model. RESULTS: A total of 680 participants were included in this study, including 283 in the PI group and 397 in the CI group. After 6 months of follow-up, the smoking cessation rate reached 30.0% in the CI group and 21.2% in the PI group. Using the Markov model, compared with the NI group, the intervention strategies of the PI group and the CI group were found to be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $535.62/QALY and $366.19/QALY, respectively. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the CI strategy was always the most cost-effective intervention. CONCLUSION: CI for smoking cessation, based in hospital and community in China, is more cost-effective than PI alone. Therefore, this smoking cessation model should be considered to be implemented in healthcare settings",10.3389/fpubh.2022.853438,1

METHODS: The internal consistency reliability is measured by Cronbach's α coefficient and the structural validity is measured by factor analysis. The difference in health utility value of different characteristic populations is compared by t test and analysis of variance RESULTS: Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.857. Exploratory factor analysis extracts two common factors whose cumulative contribution rate is 77.311%. The first common factor represents mobility, self-care and uaual activities. The second common factor represents pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The results of confirmatory factor analysis showed that the correlation of the two common factors was 0.659, the average variance of the first common factor was 0.862 and the combination reliability was 0.949, and the average variance extracted of the second common factor was 0.587 and the composite reliability was 0.739. The factor loadings for mobility, self-care and uaual activities on the first common factor were 0.871, 0.945 and 0.967, respectively. The loadings for pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression on the second common factor were 0.708 and 0.820, respectively.

4547,Cluster randomised control trial of the effect on attendance and outcomes of multi-disciplinary teams involving psychologists during pelvic floor muscle training for pelvic floor dysfunction,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pelvic Floor; Physical Therapy Modalities; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome; Pelvic floor dysfunction; attendance; clinical outcomes; pelvic floor muscle training; psychological support","Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is effective, acceptable to patients, and cost efficient as a treatment for Pelvic Floor Dysfunction (PFD). However, PFMT outcomes are mediated by patient variables, such as depression, anxiety, motivation, and health values. The current study examined whether multi-disciplinary provision of PFMT involving a psychologist would improve attendance and outcomes (Clinical Trial Registration: NCT02549157). 88 consecutively referred patients (age 28 - 85 years), with a variety of PFD, were randomised into two groups: PFMT treatment as usual (n = 47), and PFMT with a psychologist involved (n = 41). Patients received 6-month out-patient physiotherapy. More patients with the psychologist completed the course, and there were significantly greater improvements in subjective symptoms (Queensland scale), quality of life (EQ-5D), and anxiety (HADS), although not in objective measures (Oxford Grading) or depression (HADS). These results suggest that an MDT including a psychologist during PFMT intervention treatment may help some patients.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is effective, acceptable to patients, and cost efficient as a treatment for Pelvic Floor Dysfunction (PFD). However, PFMT outcomes are mediated by patient variables, such as depression, anxiety, motivation, and health values. The effectiveness of a multi-disciplinary team delivering both PFMT and psychological support simultaneously to women undergoing PFMT for PFD is unknown.What do the results of this study add? Psychological support delivered alongside PFMT increased patient attendance, improved subjective ratings of pelvic floor functioning, health-related quality of life, and reduced anxiety This is one of the first demonstrations that this can be achieved through a multi-disciplinary team delivering their support simultaneously to the patients.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Improving subjective functioning and reducing attrition rates in PFD patients has cost implications in terms of reduced need for surgery, and making future surgery more effective. The inclusion of brief, easily delivered psychological support, integrated into the PFMT sessions in a multidisciplinary way may represent an extremely cost effective method of improving the service for these patients",10.1080/01443615.2021.1904222,0
4630,Characteristics of patients with neuropathic pain syndromes screened by the painDETECT questionnaire and diagnosed by physician exam,activity impairment; functional status; health-related quality of life; neuropathic pain; pain medication use; physician diagnosis; work impairment,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics, treatment usage, and health outcomes of US adults diagnosed with neuropathic pain (NeP) by experienced physicians. METHODS: Adults with scores exceeding the threshold for probable NeP (painDETECT ≥19) and diagnosed with NeP by a qualified physician completed a questionnaire that included comorbid conditions, pain symptoms and experiences, medication use, health status (3-level EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L]: health utilities index and visual analog scale), pain severity and interference with functioning (Brief Pain Inventory), and work and activity impairment (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire) Descriptive analyses were performed for each NeP subtype. RESULTS: Participants (n=295) were predominantly female (64.4%), middle-aged (53.9%), and white (51.5%). Chronic low back pain was the most frequently diagnosed major NeP syndrome (n=166), followed by diabetic peripheral neuropathy (n=58), post-trauma neuropathy (n=47), post-surgical neuropathy (n=28), and central NeP (n=23). An additional 45 participants were diagnosed, but did not meet the criteria for the aforementioned subtypes. Participants could be diagnosed with multiple subtypes Across each NeP subtype, patients reported high rates of comorbid disease, including arthritis (range: 39.1%-64.3%) and high blood pressure (range: 26.1%-69.0%), as well as symptomology that included numbness (range: 68.1%-91.4%) and changes in muscular strength (range: 24.1%-65.2%). The majority of patients reported back pain (range: 77.8%-95.7%) and arthritis/joint pain (range: 68.1%-78.6%). The most commonly reported types of NeP pain medication were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (range: 43.1%-70.2%), weak opioids (range: 22.2%-39.3%), and strong opioids (range: 8.7%-28.6%). All six NeP groups generally reported similar levels of dysfunction on all self-report measures. The most notable finding was that the EuroQol-5D-3L health utilities index scores for each of the six groups were lower than the US norms by a clinically important amount. CONCLUSION: These exploratory findings indicate that patients with NeP across different etiologies are medically complex and experience impaired function across multiple domains",10.2147/JPR.S160513,1

It is currently unknown how the functional outcomes compare Therefore, we compared the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) of both fixation methods. Patients and methods - We performed a propensitymatched comparison of 14,404 TKRs (7,202 cemented and 7,202 cementless) enrolled in the National Joint Registry and the English National PROMs collection programme Subgroup analyses were performed in different age groups (1) < 55 years; (2) 55-64 years; (3) 65-74 years; (4) ≥ 75 years. Results - The 6-month postoperative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) was significantly (p < 0.001) higher for cemented TKR (35, SD 9.7) than cementless TKR (34, SD 9.9). The OKS was also significantly higher for the cemented TKR in all age groups, except the 55-64-year group. A significantly higher proportion of cemented TKRs had an excellent OKS (≥ 41) compared with cementless (32% vs. 28%, p < 0.001) and a lower proportion of poor (< 27) scores (19% vs. 22%, p = 0.001). This was also observed for all age subgroups. There were no significant differences in EQ-5D points gained postoperatively between the groups respectively (0.31 vs. 0.30, p = 0.1) Interpretation - Cemented TKRs had a greater proportion of excellent OKS scores and lower proportion of poor scores both overall and across all age groups However, the absolute differences are small and below the minimally clinically important difference, making both fixation types acceptable. Currently the vast majority of TKRs are cemented and the results from this study suggest that this is appropriate",10.2340/17453674.2021.896,1

METHODS: Cost-utility analyses were conducted using trial data. Utility values were captured using the EQ-5D completed by patients at 3- and 6-weekly intervals, while resource use was captured using nurse-completed report forms and patient reports. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and the main outcome was cost per incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Nonparametric bootstrapping was conducted to capture sampling uncertainty and to generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The analysis horizon was the trial period (median follow-up 12 months) and no modelling or discounting of future costs and benefits was conducted. RESULTS: Average costs were £9352 and £6218 for DXL + ASC and ASC, respectively, and average QALYs were 0.302 and 0.186, respectively. This yielded an ICER of £27,180 for DXL + ASC. DXL + ASC had a 24 % chance of being cost effective at a £20,000 QALY threshold (lambda) and a mean net monetary benefit of -£821; this rose to 59 % and £332 when the threshold was raised to £30,000. If NICE end-of-life criteria are applied, the probability of cost effectiveness increases to 90 % (at lambda = £50,000). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: DXL + ASC is likely to be cost effective if an end-of-life premium is applied. Further research should determine the impact of different utility measurement strategies and different chemotherapy delivery modes on estimates of cost effectiveness",10.1007/s40273-015-0324-5,1

Methods: A total of 92 elderly patients with femoral neck fracture who received hemiarthroplasty from July 2018 to December 2018 in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital were enrolled in this study. The average age of the participants was (75±6) years, including 31 males and 61 females, and 72(78.3%) of the patients complicated with comorbidity According to the perioperative management method, the patients were divided into the observational group (47 cases with ERAS) and the control group (45 cases with normal management). The data related to operation, hospitalization, complication and nursing satisfaction were compared between the 2 groups. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for pain evaluation. The Harris scores for hip joint and EQ-5D index scores were applied to evaluate the clinical outcomes. The follow-up were performed periodically for 3 months. The measurement data in accordance with normal distribution and homogeneity of variance were compared with t test Results: All the surgeries completed successfully and no patient died during perioperative period. Compared with the control group, the operation rate in 48 hours (χ(2)=17.781, P<0.01), bed days (Z=-4.987, P<0.01), and medical costs (Z=-4.315, P<0.01) favored that in the observational group.

Virtual reality (VR) is a promising new technology that offers opportunities to modulate patient experience and cognition and has been shown to be associated with lower levels of anxiety. In this study, we investigated changes in pre-operative anxiety levels before and after using VR in patients undergoing minor gynecological surgery. METHODS: Patients who underwent elective minor gynecological surgeries in KK Women's and Children's hospital, Singapore were recruited. The VR intervention consisted of 10-min exposure via a headset loaded with sceneries, background meditation music and breathing exercises. For the primary outcome of pre-operative anxiety, patients were assessed at pre- and post-intervention using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Secondary outcomes of self-reported satisfaction scores and EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) were also collected. RESULTS: Data analysis from 108 patients revealed that HADS anxiety scores were significantly reduced from 7.2 ± 3.3 pre-intervention to 4.6 ± 3.0 post-intervention (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, HADS depression scores were significantly reduced from 4.7 ± 3.3 pre-intervention to 2.9 ± 2.5 post-intervention (p < 0.0001). Eighty-two percent of the patients self-reported VR intervention as 'Good' or 'Excellent'. EQ-5D-3L showed significant changes in dimensions of 'usual activities' (p = 0.025), 'pain/discomfort' (p = 0.008) and 'anxiety/ depression' (p < 0.0001) CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing minor gynecological procedures, the VR intervention brought about a significant reduction in pre-operative anxiety. This finding may be clinically important to benefit patients with high pre-operative anxiety without the use of anxiolytics.

METHOD: The original English form was translated according to guidelines. We included patients with ACL injury undergoing reconstruction in two centers over 3 years. Subjects completed the translated MARS, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form and EuroQol EQ5D. The examining physician completed the Tegner Lysholm scale as an objective evaluation. Re-testing was obtained after one month. We used Spearman`s correlation to evaluate construct validity and reproducibility, Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency and intraclass correlation for test-retest reliability RESULTS: We collected valid forms from 99 patients (32.1 ± 8.8 years, 64.6% males) during the preoperative evaluation and 45 were re-tested. Significant, very good correlations were found between the MARS and Tegner Lysholm (Spearman's r = 0.712, p < 0.0001) and IKDC (Spearman's r = 0.801, p < 0.0001). Cronbach's alpha was 0.893 at the initial completion and 0.799 at re-test. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.895. CONCLUSIONS: The Romanian-translated MARS is a valid, consistent and reliable physical activity outcome measure in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction",10.3390/healthcare8030318,0

Its physiopathology remains unknown, and there is no consensus on optimal management. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of electromagnetic-focused extracorporeal shockwave treatment (F-ESWT) in patients with GTPS. METHODS: This multicenter clinical trial included 103 patients with chronic GTPS randomly assigned to the treatment group, consisting of electromagnetic F-ESWT and a specific exercise protocol, or the control group, receiving sham F-ESWT and the same exercise protocol. Both groups were treated with 3 weekly sessions; the F-ESWT group received an energy flux density of 0.20 mJ/mm, whereas the control group received 0.01 mJ/mm. Patients were assessed at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after treatment. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain at 2 months was the primary outcome. The Harris hip score (HHS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and Roles and Maudsley score were used as secondary outcomes Complications were recorded. RESULTS: The mean VAS score decreased from 6.3 at baseline in both groups to 2.0 in the F-ESWT group versus 4.7 in the control group at 2 months; the 2-month score differed significantly between groups (p < 0.001). All secondary outcomes at all follow-up intervals were significantly better in the F-ESWT group, except for the LEFS score at 1 month after treatment (p = 0.25). No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: F-ESWT in association with a specific exercise program is safe and effective for GTPS, with a success rate of 86.8% at 2 months after treatment, which was maintained until the end of follow-up.

When deciding to target remission or LDA, important considerations are the likelihood of attaining them, and their impacts on function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We have addressed this by studying: (a) the frequency of remission and LDA/remission; (b) DAS28-ESR trends after remission; (c) ability of remission vs. LDA to identify patients with normal function (HAQ ≤ 0.5) and HRQoL (EQ-5D ≥ the normal population). METHODS: We studied 571 patients in two clinical trials, and 1693 patients in a 10-year routine care cohort. We assessed the frequency and sustainability of remission and LDA/remission, variability in DAS28-ESR after remission, and sensitivity/specificity of remission and LDA/remission at identifying patients with low disability levels and normal HRQoL using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Point remission and remission/LDA were common (achieved by 35-58% and 49-74% of patients, respectively), but were rarely sustained (sustained remission and remission/LDA achieved by 5-9% and 9-16% of patients, respectively). Following attaining remission, DAS28-ESR levels varied substantially. Despite this, of those patients attaining point remission, the majority (53-61%) were in remission at study end-points. Whilst remission was highly specific at identifying patients with low disability (85-91%) it lacked sensitivity (51-57%); similar findings were seen for normal HRQoL (specificity 78-86%; sensitivity 52-59%). The optimal DAS28-cut-off to identify individuals with low disability and normal HRQoL was around the LDA threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support both the treat-to-target goals. Attaining remission is highly specific for attaining low disability and normal HRQoL, although many patients with more active disease also have good function and HRQoL. Attaining a DAS28-ESR ≤ 3.2 has a better balance of specificity and sensitivity for attaining these outcomes, with the benefit of being more readily achievable. Although sustaining these targets over time is rare, even attaining them on a one-off basis leads to better function and HRQoL outcomes for patients",10.1016/j.semarthrit.2018.12.006,1

This study seeks to compare the menstrual characteristics and symptoms of female university students reporting self-perceived normality concerning their cycles and menstruation with those who perceive their menstruation as being abnormal. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 270 nursing students using a self-report questionnaire that included sociodemographic and gynecological issues, together with Visual Analog Scale, the Andersch and Milsom Scale, and the Spanish version of the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EuroQol-5D) to measure self-perceived health status. A bivariate analysis was performed using the chi-square test, linear trend chi-square, and Student's t-test, and a multivariate analysis of stepwise binary logistic regression was performed to predict the perception of cycle abnormality. In total, 77.4% of participants displayed normality; however, in self-reporting of menstrual characteristics, 67.4% identified alterations. Young women suffering from menstrual dizziness were 1.997 (CI95% = 1.010-3.950; p = 0.047) more likely to manifest abnormal menstruation, 4.518 (CI95% = 1.239-16.477; p = 0.022) more likely if they suffered from Grade 3 menstrual pain, and 2.851 (CI95% = 1.399-5.809; p = 0.004) more likely if they perceived that menstruation interfered with their daily lives. Many menstrual changes and symptoms are still considered normal, making it difficult to identify and address these issues Therefore, it is necessary to develop health policies and strategies to improve menstrual health literacy for increased knowledge and earlier diagnosis",10.3390/ijerph17176432,0

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ECT in ulcerated vs. non-ulcerated tumors and investigate the effect on tumor-associated symptoms. METHODS: Twenty cancer centers in the International Network for Sharing Practices on Electrochemotherapy (InspECT) prospectively collected data. ECT was performed following ESOPE protocol. Response was evaluated by lesion size development. Pain, symptoms, performance status (ECOG-Index) and health status (EQ-5D questionnaire) were evaluated. RESULTS: 716 patients with ulcerated (n = 302) and non-ulcerated (n = 414) cutaneous tumors and metastases were included (minimum follow-up of 45 days). Non-ulcerated lesions responded to ECT better than ulcerated lesions (complete response 65 % vs. 51 %, p = 0.0061). Only 38 % (115/302) with ulcerated lesions before ECT presented with ulcerated lesions at final follow-up. Patients with ulcerated lesions reported higher pain and more severe symptoms compared to non-ulcerated lesions, which significantly and continuously improved following ECT. In non-ulcerated lesions however, pain spiked during the treatment. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: ECT is a safe and effective local treatment for cutaneous tumors. While ECT improves symptoms especially in patients with ulcerated lesions, data suggest the implementation of a perioperative pain management in non-ulcerated lesions during ECT",10.1111/ddg.14699,0

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 117 symptomatic outpatients with HFpEF were prospectively enrolled in Germany, England, and Slovenia as part of the Studies Investigating Co-morbidities Aggravating Heart Failure (SICA-HF). Appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) mass (the sum of muscle mass in both arms and legs) was assessed by DEXA Echocardiography, 6-minute walk testing (6-MWT), muscle strength assessment, spiroergometry and QoL evaluation using EQ-5D Questionnaire were performed Sarcopenia was defined as ASM 2 standard deviations below the mean of a healthy reference group aged 18-40years. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the E/e' value: ≤8, 9-14, and ≥15. Sarcopenia was detected in 19.7% of all patients. These patients performed worse during 6-MWT (404±116 vs. 307±145m, p=0.003) and showed lower absolute peak oxygen consumption (1579±474 vs 1211±442mL/min, p<0.05). Both ASM and muscle strength were lowest in patients with E/e' >15 (p<0.05). Higher values of muscle strength/ASM were associated with a better QoL (r=0.5, p<0.0005). Logistic regression showed ASM to be independently associated with reduced distance walked during the 6-MWT adjusted for NYHA, height, left atrium diameter, ferritin and forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) (odds ratio 1.2, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia affects a clinically relevant proportion of patients with HFpEF. Low ASM is strongly linked to reduced muscle strength, exercise capacity and QoL in these patients",10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.07.135,0

HYPOTHESIS: Treatment designed according to subgroups will improve clinical outcomes in patients unresponsive to multimodal treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective crossover intervention. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. METHODS: Patients with patellofemoral pain (PFP; n = 61; mean age, 27 ± 9 years) were enrolled. Patients with PFP received standard multimodal treatment 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Patients not responding to multimodal treatment were then classified into 1 of 3 subgroups (strong, weak and tight, and weak and pronated foot) using 6 simple clinical tests. They were subsequently administered 6 further weeks of targeted intervention, designed according to subgroup characteristics. Visual analog scale (VAS), perception of recovery scale (PRS), 5-Level European Quality 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L), and self-reported version of the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs scale (S-LANSS) were used to assess pain, knee function, and quality of life before and after the interventions. RESULTS: In total, 34% (n = 21) of patients demonstrated recovery after multimodal treatment. However, over 70% (n = 29/40) of nonresponders demonstrated recovery after targeted treatment. The VAS, PRS, S-LANSS, and EQ-5D-5L scores improved significantly after targeted intervention compared with after multimodal treatment (P < 0.001). The VAS score at rest was significantly lower in the ""weak and pronated foot"" and the ""weak and tight"" subgroups (P = 0.011 and P = 0.008, respectively). Posttreatment pain intensity on activity was significantly lower in the ""strong"" subgroup (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Targeted treatment designed according to subgroup characteristics improves clinical outcomes in patients unresponsive to multimodal treatment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Targeted intervention could be easily implemented after 6 simple clinical assessment tests to subgroup patients into 1 of 3 subgroups (strong, weak and tight, and weak and pronated foot). Targeted interventions applied according to the characteristics of these subgroups have more beneficial treatment effects than a current multimodal treatment program",10.1177/1941738119883272,1

There is a perceived reluctance to offer surgery to young patients on the basis of potential early failure of the implant. The aim of this study was to review clinical and radiological outcomes of THA in patients under the age of 30 years in a high-volume specialist arthroplasty unit. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients between 1989 and 2009 was undertaken. 95 patients (118 THAs) were identified but 17 patients were excluded for lack of clinical records or for follow-up under 5 years. Clinical records were reviewed for demographics, underlying pathology, details of operation and failures. Radiographs were reviewed for evidence of loosening and wear of the components. Functional assessment was carried out using the modified Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Oxford Hip Score and EQ-5D-5L. RESULTS: Mean age was 25 (16-30) years and 65% patients were females. The most common underlying pathologies were development dysplasia of the hip (29%) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (25%) Mean follow-up was 12.6 (5-24) years, during which 19 patients (25%) were revised. The majority of the revisions were for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons are cautious when considering THA in very young patients despite the significant documented improvement in function and quality of life after THA. This study reports on the mid- to long-term results of THA which will be valuable when advising young patients on the prospects of revision surgery at the time of primary THA",10.1177/1120700020901685,0

AIM: To investigate the effect of multimorbidity on functional and quality of life outcomes in women with generalized osteoathritis (hand and knee arthritis, GOA). METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, patients according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for OA were invited. The control group consisted of subjects without any musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoarthritis or inflammatory rheumatic disease. Comorbidity count was calculated from the investigated comorbidities. In the GOA group, the function was assessed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Cochin Hand Scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), while quality of life was measured in both groups with the EuroQol-5D Scale. Interaction between summarized comorbidity count, age, body mass index (BMI) and scores were analysed. Descriptive statistics, two-sample t-test and Pearson's correlation test were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The study groups included 200-200 participants with a similar age spread. Significant correlation was demonstrated in both study groups between higher comorbidity count and older age (0.37, p<0.001, and 0.24, p<0.001 in the GOA and the control group, respectively) and higher BMI (0.18, p: 0.01, and 0.45, p<0.001 in the GOA and the control group, respectively). In GOA, the increasing comorbidity number had a negative effect on the measured outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Age and BMI showed strong correlation with multimorbidity in both groups. The lower correlation between BMI and comorbidity count in the GOA group requires further investigation and may suggest different interactions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 22 patients referred to our pain clinic, AZ Sint-Nikolaas, between 2010 and 2015, was conducted using the McGill Pain and EuroQoL questionnaire before, two weeks after, and at the final follow-up after neurostimulator treatment. RESULTS: Successful test stimulations were achieved for 77.3% of patients, with satisfactory long-term pain relief reported by 44% at 24 months. The predictive value of the trial stimulation was 80%, with 82.4% of patients reporting one or more complication, the most common being neck discomfort due to fibrosis. A small cohort size (22) limited our statistical analyses. However younger patients presented with a higher incidence of negative results after 24 months or physical complications. Cut-off ages were set at the age of 62 and 58 years respectively CONCLUSION: Stimulation of the Gasserian ganglion is a promising technique for the treatment of refractory TNP and should be considered ahead of more invasive techniques such as motor cortex or deep brain stimulation. The referral of refractory TNP patients should also be accomplished as early as possible to improve outcome",10.1016/j.jcms.2016.10.014,0
7551,Short-term Montreal Cognitive Assessment predicts functional outcome after endovascular therapy,MoCA; endovascular therapy; functional outcome; post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI); risk factors,"BACKGROUND: The previous studies have shown that cognition in patients 4-8 weeks after stroke can predict early functional outcomes after stroke. The analyses of data from the REVASCAT trial proved that stent thrombectomy improves post-morbid wiring test outcomes in patients with AIS compared with drug therapy. However, few studies focus on the relationship between cognitive impairment and functional outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular treatment. METHODS: A total of 647 participants registered from stroke centers. Stroke severity was evaluated by National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS). The functional status was estimated by modified Rankin scale (mRS). The cognitive impairment was assessed by trained neurologists at 14 (±4) and 90 (±7) days after stroke onset using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A MoCA score of less than 26 was considered post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). RESULTS: A total of 120 Patients who underwent endovascular therapy were included. The PSCI group had higher levels of age, men, educational status, atrial fibrillation, smoking, alcoholism, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score of the anterior circulation, and OTP time than the non-PSCI group (p < 0.05). In contrast, the 14-day MoCA score, 14-day NIHSS score, 3-month MoCA score, 3-month NIHSS score, 3-month mRS score, and 3-month EQ5D score were lower in those PSCI patients. The risk predictors of PSCI were age, sex, educational level, atrial fibrillation, smoking, alcoholism, ASPECT Score (anterior circulation), 14-day MoCA score, and 14-day NIHSS score There were strong relationships between 3-month NIHSS and MoCA (r = -0.483, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that 14-day MoCA score, memory, abstraction, visuospatial/executive functions, attention, and language, played a significant role to predict PSCI [area under the curve (AUC) > 0.7]. It had predictive value for the 14-day visuospatial/executive functions to predict 3-month functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: Early application of the MoCA in different cognitive regions could predict the PSCI and future functional outcomes, which is necessary to screen high-risk patients with poor prognosis and conduct an early intervention",10.3389/fnagi.2022.808415,0

This study aims to assess individual changes in mental health and health status before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore potential predictors of change. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Germany (n = 15 037) were conducted. Demographics, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed. Additionally, all instruments used were adapted to measure the participants' mental health and health status before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Impairment in mental health was predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Pre-existing mental illness predicted an increase in depression symptoms and a deterioration in health status. Trust in governmental actions and the subjective level of information predicted less increase in psychological burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed that there have been changes in mental health and health status at an individual level since the outbreak of COVID-19. In order to maintain mental health, the observed predictors should be addressed",10.1177/2150132720953682,0
7934,The impact of loneliness and social isolation on health state utility values: a systematic literature review,Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Loneliness; Quality of Life/psychology; Social Isolation; Economic burden; Health burden; Health state utility values; Loneliness; Social isolation,"BACKGROUND: Loneliness and social isolation are recognised as social problems and denote a significant health burden. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to explore the health state utility values (HSUVs) associated with loneliness and/or social isolation. METHOD: Peer-reviewed journals published in English language that reported both HSUVs along with loneliness and/or social isolation scores were identified through five databases No restrictions were made relating to the population, study design or utility estimation method used. RESULTS: In total, 19 papers were included; 12 included a measure of loneliness, four studies included a measure of social isolation and three studies considered both loneliness and social isolation. All studies focused on individuals with pre-existing health conditions-where the EQ-5D-3L instrument was most frequently used to assess HSUVs. HSUVs ranged from 0.5 to 0.95 in those who reported not being lonely, 0.42 to 0.97 in those who experienced some level of loneliness, 0.3 to 0.87 in those who were socially isolated and 0.63 to 0.94 in those who were not socially isolated. CONCLUSION: There was significant variation in HSUVs complicated by the presence of co-morbidities, population heterogeneity, variations in methods used to derive utility scores and differences in the measurement of loneliness and/or social isolation. Nevertheless, the lower HSUVs observed should be considered to significantly impact quality of life, though we also note the need for further research to explore the unique impact of loneliness and social isolation on HSUVs that can be used in the future economic evaluations",10.1007/s11136-021-03063-1,1

This study aimed to investigate the 1-year outcomes of these patients or patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) and compare their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to the general population. METHODS: Severe ARDS survivors admitted to two ICUs in China between January 2012 and January 2014 were enrolled. Of the severe ARDS survivors enrolled, 1-year postdischarge, HRQoL assessment using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol questionnaire dimensions, 6-min walking distance, chest computed tomography scan, pulmonary function, and arterial blood gas analysis were compared for ARDS patients with or without ECMO. RESULTS: ARDS patients receiving ECMO had a significantly higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (30.3 ± 6.7 vs. 26.5 ± 7.3, P= 0.036), lung injury score (3.3 ± 0.4 vs. 2.8 ± 0.5, P= 0.000), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (10.8 ± 3.5 vs. 7.9 ± 3.1, P= 0.000), lower PaO2/FiO2ratio ([mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa], 68.3 ± 16.1 vs. 84.8 ± 16.5, P= 0.000), and increased extrapulmonary organ failure (2 [1, 3] vs. 1 [1, 1], P= 0.025) compared with patients not receiving ECMO. ECMO and non-ECMO survivors showed similar pulmonary function, morphological abnormalities, resting arterial blood gas values, and 6-min walking distance. Mild pulmonary dysfunction and abnormal morphology were observed in a few survivors. In addition, ECMO and non-ECMO survivors showed a similar quality of life. ECMO survivors showed lower SF-36 physical functioning and role-physical domain scores (minimum clinically significant difference at least 5 points), and non-ECMO survivors had similar outcome. CONCLUSIONS: One-year posthospital discharge, severe ARDS survivors receiving ECMO or MV demonstrated comparable outcomes. Compared with the general population, ARDS survivors showed reduced HRQoL. Pulmonary function and lung morphology revealed sufficient recovery with minor lung impairment",10.4103/0366-6999.205847,1

METHODS: Patients meeting Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) classification criteria for axSpA, but not modified New York radiographic criteria, received double-blind ETN 50 mg/week or placebo (PBO) for 12 weeks, then open-label ETN (ETN/ETN or PBO/ETN). Clinical, health, productivity, MRI and safety outcomes were assessed and the 48-week data are presented here. RESULTS: 208/225 patients (92%) entered the open-label phase at week 12 (ETN, n=102; PBO, n=106). The percentage of patients achieving ASAS40 increased from 33% to 52% between weeks 12 and 48 for ETN/ETN and from 15% to 53% for PBO/ETN (within-group p value <0.001 for both). For ETN/ETN and PBO/ETN, the EuroQol 5 Dimensions utility score improved by 0.14 and 0.08, respectively, between baseline and week 12 and by 0.23 and 0.22 between baseline and week 48 Between weeks 12 and 48, MRI Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada sacroiliac joint (SIJ) scores decreased by -1.1 for ETN/ETN and by -3.0 for PBO/ETN, p<0.001 for both.

The prospective non-interventional multicenter PRO-QURE study aimed at assessing correlations between PGIC and pain measurements and treatment effects in patients followed in French pain centres. METHODS: Respectively, 495 and 379 patients with peripheral neuropathic pain initiating treatment with capsaicin 8% cutaneous patch(es) (female, 62.6%; mean age, 54.0 ± 14.8 years; post-surgical or traumatic pain, 52.7%; mean pain duration, 42.2 ± 54.1 months; DN4 score >4, 92.9%) completed the PGIC and several other PRO instruments before (baseline) and 3 months (M3) after treatment application. RESULTS: At M3, improvement (""much improved"" or ""very much improved"") was observed in 23.0% of patients, associated with decreases of -3.0 ± 2.2, -2.5 ± 2.4, and -23.1 ± 19.7 in BPI pain intensity, BPI pain interference and NPSI total scores, respectively. The highest Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with PGIC were found for pain intensity (BPI: r = -0.479, p < 0.001), satisfaction with current state (Patient Acceptable Symptomatic State: r = 0.455, p < 0.001), and treatment effectiveness (TSQM: r = 0.431, p < 0.001); correlation coefficients were lower for all NPSI scores, BPI pain interference score, HAD scores and EQ-5D-3L index. CONCLUSIONS: In daily clinical practice, significant improvement in peripheral neuropathic pain, as assessed by PGIC scores, significantly correlated with changes in well-established measures of pain intensity, pain interference with activities of daily living, mood and quality of life, confirming its clinical interest as PRO measure in real-world conditions. SIGNIFICANCE: Clinically important improvement in peripheral neuropathic pain, as assessed by PGIC scores, significantly correlated with well-established measures of pain intensity, pain interference in daily life and treatment efficacy. This result, associated with the ease of administration and scoring, encourages the widespread use of the PGIC in daily practice",10.1002/ejp.1378,1
8732,"A cluster randomised feasibility pilot trial evaluating involving community-dwelling older adults in activities in relation to meals in a rehabilitation program; recruitment, data collection and protocol",Activities of daily living; Community health care; Dwelling older adults; Meals on wheels; Rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: Community-dwelling older adults receiving support at home such as meals-on-wheels may lose the ability to preserve social, cognitive, and functional abilities, when becoming accustomed to and dependent of community aged care. When still able to cook older adults often hold some control over the foods that are prepared and which they eat, and which helps to foster identity. The purpose of this study is to assess feasibility of outcome measurements and sample size when conducting a pilot cluster randomized trial to evaluate community-dwelling older adults being involved in activities in relation to meals in a rehabilitation program. METHODS: This cluster randomized controlled study will consist of two clusters of a total of 5 community aged care areas; the intervention cluster, which hold 3 community aged care areas and the control cluster which hold 2 areas. The 130 community-dwelling older adults, receiving meals-on-wheels, will randomly be allocated to either the intervention cluster consisting of 8 weeks of participation in a rehabilitation program led by a Case Manager or the control cluster receiving usual community aged care. The primary outcome will be assessment of data collection (ratio between completed- and non-completed data) and assessment of sample size. The secondary clinical outcomes will be health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3 L), muscle strength (chair stand), nutritional status (weight/BMI), loneliness (UCLA scale), mental well-being (Warwich-Edinburgh scale), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy scale), satisfaction with food-related life (SWFL scale) and refrigerator content.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of nivolumab on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after radical resection in patients with MIUC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from 709 patients in CheckMate 274 (NCT02632409; 282 with programmed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression ≥1%), an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of adjuvant nivolumab INTERVENTION: Intravenous injection of nivolumab (240 mg) or placebo every 2 wk for ≤1 yr. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EQ-5D-3L. Linear mixed-effect models for repeated measures were used to compare nivolumab and placebo on changes in HRQoL. Time to confirmed deterioration (TTCD) of HRQoL was analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In the full HRQoL evaluable population, no clinically meaningful deterioration of HRQoL was observed in either treatment arm. Moreover, nivolumab was noninferior to placebo on changes from baseline for all main outcomes. The median TTCD for fatigue was 41.0 wk for nivolumab and 44.3 wk for placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.39). For the visual analog scale, the median TTCD was not reached for nivolumab and it was 57.6 wk for placebo (HR: 0.78, 95% CI, 0.61-1.00). The median TTCD for the other main outcomes was not reached in either treatment arm. The findings were similar for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that nivolumab did not compromise the HRQoL of patients with MIUC in CheckMate 274. PATIENT SUMMARY: Nivolumab is being researched as a new treatment for patients with bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma). We found that nivolumab maintained quality of life while increasing the time until cancer returns in patients whose bladder cancer had spread or grown and who had unsuccessfully tried platinum-containing chemotherapy",10.1016/j.euo.2022.02.003,0

However, these interventions pose relatively new regulatory, organisational and technological challenges that limit appropriate evaluation. Lung Cancer App (LuCApp) is a mobile application developed by researchers and clinicians to promote real-time monitoring and management of patients' symptoms. This protocol illustrates a clinical trial designed to evaluate the usability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LuCApp versus standard of care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a 24-week two-arm non-blinded multicentre parallel randomised controlled trial. A total of 120 adult patients diagnosed with small or non-small cell lung cancer and eligible for pharmaceutical treatments will be allocated 1:1 to receiving either standard care or LuCApp in addition to standard care at three oncology sites in Northern Italy. During the treatment period, LuCApp allows daily monitoring and grading of a list of symptoms, which trigger alerts to the physicians in case predefined severity thresholds are met. Patients will complete a baseline assessment and a set of valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measures every 3±1 weeks, and up to 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in the score of the Trial Outcome Index in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (Lung) questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes are the Lung Cancer Subscale, the EuroQoL 5D-5L questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form, the app usability questionnaire and the Zarit Burden Interview for the main caregiver. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial received ethical approval from the three clinical sites. Trial results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations CONCLUSIONS: This trial makes a timely contribution to test a mobile application designed to improve the quality of life and delivery of care for patients with lung cancer.

9005,Locking Plate Arthrodesis Compares Favorably with LRTI for Thumb Trapeziometacarpal Arthrosis: Early Outcomes from a Longitudinal Cohort Study,LRTI; basal joint arthritis; fusion; thumb CMC; trapeziometacarpal,"BACKGROUND: Trapeziometacarpal arthrodesis (TMA) has been complicated by nonunion and hardware failure. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We hypothesized that modification of the TMA technique with a locking cage plate construct would afford reliable bony union while producing greater hand function than trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI) at early follow-up. METHODS: We enrolled 36 consecutive patients with trapeziometacapal osteoarthritis (14 TMA patients (15 thumbs), 22 LRTI patients (22 thumbs)). The study was powered to detect a minimal clinically important difference on the QuickDASH questionnaire between groups. Secondary outcomes included Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ), VAS-pain, and EQ-5D-3L scores. Patients were examined to evaluate thumb motion and strength. TMA patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically for union. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 15.6 months, and the mean age was 59.2 years Union was achieved in 14/15 (93%) of TMA thumbs. Improvement in QuickDASH scores was similar after TMA and LRTI (49 to 28 and 50 to 18, respectively) Postoperative patient-rated upper extremity function, health status, and pain were similar between groups. Pinch strength was significantly greater after TMA (5.9 vs 4.7 kg). No differences in thumb or wrist range of motion were observed postoperatively with the exception of greater total metacarpophalangeal joint motion after TMA. Complications after TMA included nonunion (7%), development of symptomatic scaphotrapezotrapezoidal (STT) arthrosis (7%), symptomatic hardware (7%), and superficial branch of the radial nerve (SBRN) paresthesia (7%) Complications after LRTI included subsidence (5%), MP hyperextension deformity (5%), and SBRN paresthesias (5%). CONCLUSIONS: At early follow-up, patient-rated function was similar among patients undergoing TMA and LRTI. TMA produced 25% greater pinch strength compared with LRTI. Despite historical concerns regarding global loss of ROM with arthrodesis, motion was similar between groups. Our observed TMA nonunion rate of 7% is low relative to historically reported nonunion rates (7-16%). Locking cage plate technology affords rigid fixation for TMA with promising early results noting reliable bony union while minimizing complications",10.1007/s11420-016-9527-3,0
9049,Psychometric validation and responder definition of the sleep disturbance numerical rating scale in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,"Adult; Dermatitis, Atopic/complications/diagnosis; Humans; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep","BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance (SD) is an important part of the burden of atopic dermatitis (AD), but patient-reported outcomes that are easy to understand and interpret in the target population have been lacking. A daily, single-item, self-reported SD 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) was recently developed to assess SD for patients with moderate-to-severe AD, but its psychometric properties have not yet been described. OBJECTIVES: To assess the psychometric properties of the SD NRS in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. METHODS: The psychometric properties of the SD NRS were assessed using data from a phase IIb clinical trial in 218 adults with moderate-to-severe AD. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability of the SD NRS was substantial to almost perfect (interclass correlation 0·66-1·00) in participants who had stable SD or stable pruritus scores over 1 week. Baseline correlations were moderate to large (r > 0·30) between SD NRS and pruritus or sleep loss scores, but were small (r = -0·11 to 0·17) between SD NRS and EQ-5D-3L index and visual analogue scores, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Scoring Atopic Dermatitis, and Investigator's Global Assessment. The SD NRS could discriminate groups of participants in the expected direction according to different quality-of-life scores but not according to different clinician-reported disease severity scores. SD NRS scores significantly decreased as sleep loss, itch and quality-of-life scores improved Analysis of meaningful change suggested a 2-5-point improvement as the initial range of responder definition in the SD NRS score. CONCLUSIONS: The SD NRS is a reliable, valid and responsive measure of SD in adults with moderate-to-severe AD",10.1111/bjd.20783,0

METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all adult patients with psoriasis enrolled in the Corrona Psoriasis Registry between April 2015 and May 2018 who initiated a biologic therapy at registry enrollment. Patients were stratified by the presence of scalp, nail, or palmoplantar psoriasis (nonmutually exclusive groups). Patient demographics, clinical char-acteristics, disease activity, and patient-reported outcome measures (pain, fatigue, itch, EuroQol visual analog scale [EQ VAS], Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI], and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire [WPAI]) were assessed at registry enrollment and compared between patients with versus without each challenging-to-treat area using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and χ2 or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. Generalized linear regression models were used to estimate differences in disease activity and patient-reported outcomes between patients with versus without each challenging-to-treat area RESULTS: Among 2,042 patients with psoriasis (mean age [±SD], 49.6 ± 14.7 years; 51.5% male), 38.4% had psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 38.1% had scalp psoriasis, 16.0% had nail psoriasis, 10.9% had palmoplantar psoriasis, and 26.2% had a combination of ≥2 challenging-to-treat areas and PsA; only 34.2% had body plaque psoriasis without PsA or challenging-to-treat areas. Patients in all challenging-to-treat groups reported higher (mean [95% CI]) itch (scalp, 58.01 [57.62-58.40] vs. 54.35 [53.99-54.72]; nail, 56.42 [56.02-56.81] vs. 55.59 [55.20-55.97]; palmoplantar, 60.22 [59.86-60.59] vs. 55.15 [54.79-55.54]) and lower EQ VAS (scalp, 68.12 [67.78-68.48] vs. 69.46 [69.12-69.81]; nail, 66.21 [65.89-66.55] vs. 69.48 [69.14-69.83]; palmoplantar, 66.21 [66.07-66.75] vs 69.29 [68.94-69.94]) scores than those without the respective challenging-to-treat localization. Patients with nail or palmoplantar psoriasis reported higher pain, fatigue, and DLQI scores than those without. Higher proportions of patients with scalp or palmoplantar psoriasis reported work impairment compared with those without. CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of patients with psoriasis who initiated biologic therapy had PsA and/or ≥1 challenging-to-treat area. Patients with challenging-to-treat areas had worse patient-reported outcome scores than those without, indicating a significant burden of challenging-to-treat areas on patients' quality of life",10.1159/000504841,0
9334,Surgical outcomes between posterior decompression alone and posterior decompression with fusion surgery among patients with Meyerding grade 2 degenerative spondylolisthesis: a multicenter cohort study,"Blood Loss, Surgical; Cohort Studies; Constriction, Pathologic/complications/surgery; Decompression, Surgical/adverse effects/methods; Female; Humans; Hypesthesia/surgery; Low Back Pain/surgery; Lumbar Vertebrae/surgery; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Fusion/adverse effects/methods; Spinal Stenosis/complications/surgery; Spondylolisthesis/complications/surgery; Treatment Outcome; Central canal stenosis; Decompression; Fusion; Meyerding grade 2 degenerative spondylolisthesis; Multicenter retrospective cohort study; Patient-reported outcome measure","BACKGROUND: Whether lumbar decompression with fusion surgery is effective against Meyerding grade 2 degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is unknown. Therefore, the current study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes between posterior decompression alone and posterior decompression with fusion surgery among patients with grade 2 DS with central canal stenosis. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included prospectively registered patients (n = 3863) who underwent surgery for degenerative lumbar spinal canal stenosis at nine high-volume spine centers from April 2017 to July 2019. Patients with grade 2 DS and central canal stenosis were included in the analysis. Patients with radiculopathy, including foraminal stenosis, degenerative scoliosis, and concomitant anterior spinal fusion, and those with a previous history of lumbar surgery were excluded. The participants were divided into the decompression alone group (group D) and decompression with fusion surgery group (group F). Data about patient-reported outcomes, including Numeric Rating Scale (low back pain, leg pain, leg numbness, and foot numbness), Oswestry Disability Index, EuroQol Five-Dimensional questionnaire, and 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores, were obtained preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively. RESULTS: In total, 2354 (61%) patients, including 42 (1.8%) with grade 2 DS (n = 18 in group D and n = 24 in group F), completed the 2-year follow-up. Group D had a higher proportion of female patients than group F. However, the two groups did not significantly differ in terms of other baseline demographic characteristics. Group D had a significantly shorter surgical time and lower volume of intraoperative blood loss than group F. Postoperative patient-reported outcomes did not significantly differ between the two groups, although the preoperative degree of low back pain was higher in group F than in group D. The slip degree of group D did not worsen during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: The surgical outcomes were similar regardless of the addition of fusion surgery among patients with grade 2 DS Decompression alone was superior to decompression with fusion surgery as it was associated with a lower volume of intraoperative blood loss and shorter surgical time",10.1186/s12891-022-05850-4,1

OBJECTIVE: To ascertain if a supervised-facility multicomponent exercise program (MEP) when performed by frail older persons can reverse frailty and improve functionality; cognitive, emotional, and social networking; as well as biological biomarkers of frailty, when compared with a controlled population that received no training. DESIGN: This is an interventional, controlled, simple randomized study. Researchers responsible for data gathering were blinded for this study. SETTING: Participants from 2 primary rural care centers (Sollana and Carcaixent) of the same health department in Spain were enrolled in the study between December 2013 and September 2014. PATIENTS: We randomized a volunteer sample of 100 men and women who were sedentary, with a gait speed lower than 0.8 meters per second and frail (met at least 3 of the frailty phenotype criteria). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a supervised-facility MEP (n = 51, age = 79.5, SD 3.9) that included proprioception, aerobic, strength, and stretching exercises for 65 minutes, 5 days per week, 24 weeks, or to a control group (n = 49, age = 80.3, SD 3.7). The intervention was performed by 8 experienced physiotherapists or nurses. Protein-calorie and vitamin D supplementation were controlled in both groups. RESULTS: Our MEP reverses frailty (number needed to treat to recover robustness in subjects with attendance to ≥50% of the training sessions was 3.2) and improves functional measurements: Barthel (trained group 91.6 SD 8.0 vs 82.0 SD 11.0 control group), Lawton and Brody (trained group 6.9 SD 0.9 vs 5.7 SD 2.0 control group), Tinetti (trained group 24.5 SD 4.4 vs 21.7 SD 4.5 control group), Short Physical Performance Battery (trained group 9.5 SD 1.8 vs 7.1 SD 2.8 control group), and physical performance test (trained group 23.5 SD 5.9 vs 16.5 SD 5.1 control group) as well as cognitive, emotional, and social networking determinations: Mini-Mental State Examination (trained group 28.9 SD 3.9 vs 25.9 SD 7.3 control group), geriatric depression scale from Yesavage (trained group 2.3 SD 2.2 vs 3.2 SD 2.0 control group), EuroQol quality-of-life scale (trained group 8.2 SD 1.6 vs 7.6 SD 1.3 control group), and Duke social support (trained group 48.5 SD 9.3 vs 41.2 SD 8.5 control group). This program is unique in that it leads to a decrease in the number of visits to primary care physician (trained group 1.3 SD 1.4 vs 2.4 SD 2.9 control group) and to a significant improvement in frailty biomarkers CONCLUSIONS: We have designed a multicomponent exercise intervention that reverses frailty and improves cognition, emotional, and social networking in a controlled population of community-dwelling frail older adults.

We investigated persistent irAEs and implications on patients' lives compared to non-ICI-induced autoimmune diseases (AIs). METHODS: The multicentre, cross-sectional study comprised 200 patients with cancer ≥12 weeks after ICI cessation (ICI-patients) and 2705 patients with AIs (AI-patients), recruited in German outpatient clinics and support groups. The prevalence of persistent irAEs subdivided in long-term (12 weeks to <12 months) and chronic irAEs (≥12 months) since ICI discontinuation, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the EuroQol 5D-5L (EQ-Index/VAS score), and burden of autoimmune symptoms and respective therapies were assessed. RESULTS: Long-term/chronic irAEs occurred in 51.9%/35.5% of outpatient ICI-patients, including arthralgia (16.7%/16.1%), myalgia (13.0%/14.0%), hypothyroidism (11.1%/10.8%), xerostomia (7.4%/8.6%), vitiligo (13.0%/7.5%) and hypophysitis (9.3%/7.5%). ICI-patients with long-term/chronic irAEs reported clinically significantly reduced HRQoL compared to ICI-patients without long-term/chronic irAEs (EQ-Index score: 0.767/0.752 versus 0.920/0.923, p < 0.001/0.001; EQ-VAS score: 52.2/52.0 versus 63.6/74.7, p =/< 0.040/0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses confirmed clinically significant reductions in HRQoL scores by chronic irAEs (EQ-Index/VAS score: -0.163/-23.4, p < 0.001/0.001). HRQoL, burden of autoimmune symptoms and burden of respective therapies in ICI-patients with chronic irAEs were similar to AI-patients with non-exacerbated AIs. Patients with chronic irAEs felt inadequately informed about side-effects compared to patients without chronic irAEs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Persistent irAEs impose a significant burden on patients after ICI cessation. Especially in early tumour stages, risk-benefit ratios must be carefully evaluated, and patients need to be informed about potential long-term sequelae",10.1016/j.ejca.2022.08.029,1

We present a randomised feasibility trial protocol designed to prospectively investigate the influence of vitamin D testing, and subsequent supplementation for deficiency, prior to THR/TKR. METHODS/DESIGN: One hundred adult patients undergoing primary THR/TKR for osteoarthritis at two NHS hospital trusts in North East England will be recruited. Exclusion criteria include lack of mental capacity, revision surgery, participants already taking vitamin D/calcium supplements, or a known contraindication to vitamin D treatment Participants will be ineligible for the trial if they have an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/minute. We will measure patients' vitamin D levels at baseline, and those identified as deficient (vitamin D < 50 nmol/L) will be randomised to receive either vitamin D supplementation or no supplementation prior to, and for 6 months following, surgery. Patients with a normal vitamin D level (≥50 nmol/L) will receive no supplementation. Vitamin D levels will be rechecked on the day of surgery and again at 6 months. Patients will also complete a lifestyle questionnaire, as well as the Oxford hip or knee and EQ-5D-3 L PROM questionnaires, at baseline and at 6 months following surgery The aims are to determine the feasibility of the methodology and to gather data to inform the conduct of a future, larger trial to investigate if supplementation with vitamin D, in those who are deficient, prior to THR/TKR improves outcomes as measured by PROM scores. DISCUSSION: Previous reports have measured vitamin D levels and correlated this to outcome, but we can find no randomised trial in which researchers investigated the effect of supplementation. The aim of this trial is to determine if vitamin D deficiency is a modifiable risk factor for poor outcome after THR/TKR.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. About 10 to 12 patients undergoing PD were randomly selected from each of the 10 hospitals located in every part of Thailand. Face-to-face interviews were conducted from October 2008 to February 2009. Patients assessed their health status by using five domains and a visual analogue scale. The EQ-5D score was calculated on the basis of responses to five domains by using the Thai value set. Multiple regression analyses using a stepwise method were employed to model the associations between the EQ-5D score, the VAS score, and patient characteristics. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 42.2 ± 13.8 years; 53% were male. The mean PD duration was 7.4 ± 6.0 months. The mean EQ-5D and visual analogue scale scores were 0.65 ± 0.23 and 0.65 ± 0.26, respectively. The EQ-5D score was higher than that obtained from a meta-analysis study (0.58). The multivariate regression model showed that education, work status, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease symptoms were significant predictors of the EQ-5D score. The significant predictors of the VAS score included work status, albumin level, use of erythropoietin, and end-stage renal disease symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This Thai PD sample yielded higher EQ-5D scores than did other PD populations. To improve the health utility of Thai patients undergoing PD, the significant factors should be addressed. Because our PD sample had a short PD duration, their long-term health utility should be evaluated in future research",10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.005,1

EQ-5D and HUI3 utility scores were compared and their construct validity and test-retest reliability were examined by comparing these scores in groups differing in health status and using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), respectively RESULTS: EQ-5D and HUI3 utility scores in 114 patients differentiated well between varying health states; e.g., patients with higher SF-36 vitality scores had better EQ-5D and HUI3 utility scores (mean: 0.79 for both instruments) than patients with lower vitality scores (mean: 0.68 and 0.69, respectively) (p < 0.01 for both comparisons). ICC values for the EQ-5D and HUI3 were 0.64 and 0.75, respectively (n = 90, median interval: 7 days). EQ-5D and HUI3 utility scores were similar (mean +/- SD: 0.75 +/- 0.21 vs 0.76 +/- 0.17, p = 0.647, paired t test) and showed moderate correlation (Spearman's r: 0.45, p < 0.001) Differences were present in patients' responses to these 2 instruments: e.g., 12 patients reporting no problems with mobility (EQ-5D item) reported different levels of disability with ambulation (HUI3 item). CONCLUSIONS: The EQ-5D and HUI3 performed equally well in measuring utility-based HRQoL in patients with rheumatic disease, although they measured slightly different, though related, dimensions of health",na,1

METHODS: The Singapore Mental Health Study was a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of a nationally representative sample of the resident (citizens and permanent residents) population in Singapore. The diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were established using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0). Index scores were derived using the Singapore preference weights RESULTS: In general, the mean EQ-5D index score using Singapore preference weights decreased with increased age. The EQ-5D Malay version reported lower mean EQ-5D index than the English version. In multivariate analysis, the mean EQ-5D index for respondents with MDD, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, GAD, OCD, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis or rheumatism, neurological condition, stroke or major paralysis, heart attack, back problems, stomach ulcer, kidney failure, migraine headaches, and chronic lung disease was significantly lower than those without these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of the Singapore preference weights for EQ-5D valuations when measuring health-related quality of life and comparing the health burden of psychiatric and chronic physical conditions among adults in Singapore",10.1007/s11136-014-0859-5,1

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study EUROASPIRE III. SETTING: Quality of life data (QoL) were available on 8745 patients hospitalized for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or myocardial ischemia. They were interviewed and examined at least 6 months after their hospital admission. Reliability and validity of the 3 instruments were tested. Internal consistency, and discriminative, convergent, criterion and construct validity were assessed. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha indicated good internal consistency for all measures (0.73 to 0.87). Discriminative validity analyses confirmed significant QoL differences between known groups: age, gender, educational level. In addition, all hypothesized correlations between QoL constructs (convergent validity) and items (criterion validity) were confirmed with significant correlations. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated good construct validity for HADS and SF-12v2. On country-specific level, results were roughly similar. CONCLUSION: The EQ-5D as well as the SF-12v2 and the HADS are reliable and valid instruments for use in a stable coronary population, both on aggregate European level and on country-specific level. However, our results must be generalized with caution, because EUROASPIRE III patients might not be representative for all patients with stable coronary heart disease",10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.06.025,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed using the EUROQOL-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D) on 38 patients (age: 53 +/- 2 years, 82% men) who were analyzed consecutively during the pretransplant period, as well as at 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation. We excluded pediatric transplants, retransplantations, heart and lung transplantation, and patients scoring below 17 points on the Folstein's Cognitive Mini-Examination. The studied variables included the five dimensions of the EQ-5D test: mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain-discomfort, anxiety and depression; a visual analog scale from 0 to 100; and perception of health status. Statistics included analysis of variance and chi-square tests Significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: There were significant differences in all tested parameters. The worst values were observed prior to transplantation, with a significant improvement at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with heart failure showed a significant impairment in health-related quality of life before transplantation. The improvement in health-related quality of life was significant and rapidly evident in the posttransplantation period. The most affected dimensions were activities of daily living and pain-discomfort. All dimensions became stable at 3 months, except for anxiety and depression. At 6 to 12 months, a plateau was reached in the feelings of well-being",10.1016/j.transproceed.2006.08.017,1

The purpose of the current study was to validate two generic measures in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes in Scotland and England completed two generic measures: EQ-5D and Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB). Two diabetes-specific measures were administered: ADS and DSC-R. Analyses assessed reliability and validity. RESULTS: There were 130 participants (53 Scotland; 77 England; 64% male; mean age = 55.7 years). Responses on the EQ-5D and PGWB reflected moderate impairment consistent with previous diabetes samples: mean EQ-5D Index score, 0.75; EQ-5D VAS, 68.8; PGWB global score, 67.9. All scales of the PGWB demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.77 to 0.97). The EQ-5D and PGWB demonstrated convergent validity through significant correlations with the ADS (r = 0.48 to 0.61), DSC-R scales (r = 0.33 to 0.81 except ophthalmology subscale), and Body Mass Index (r = 0.15 to 0.38). The EQ-5D and PGWB discriminated between groups of patients known to differ in diabetes-related characteristics (e.g., history of hypoglycemia) CONCLUSION: Results support the use of the EQ-5D and PGWB among patients with type 2 diabetes, possibly in combination with condition-specific measures",10.1186/1477-7525-5-47,1
10631,Self-reported chronic conditions and EQ-5D index scores in the US adult population,Adult; Aged; Chronic Disease/epidemiology; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States/epidemiology,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the unique health-related quality of life (HRQoL) decrements associated with common chronic conditions in the general US adult population. METHODS: Data were obtained from a study aimed at establishing a US population-based set of preference weights for the health states defined by the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a brief, self-completed instrument for describing and valuing HRQoL. As part of that study, along with the EQ-5D items, data regarding socio-demographic characteristics and chronic medical conditions were collected The EQ-5D has five dimensions, from which an index score can be calculated that falls on a scale where 0.0 = death and 1.0 = perfect health. Ordinary least squares regression models were conducted using the EQ-5D index score as the dependent variable to estimate the association between each chronic condition and the index score after adjusting for socio-demographic variables. The population sampling weights were applied in the analyses to adjust for the over-sampling of the minority groups. RESULTS: Approximately three-fifths (62.5%) of the study sample reported having at least one of the 18 chronic medical conditions; sinusitis(24.8%), hypertension (23.5%), and arthritis (21.5%) were the most commonly reported conditions. The chronic conditions that had the greatest negative association with EQ-5D index scores were depression and arthritis CONCLUSION: Unique associations were found between several chronic conditions and HRQoL after accounting for the presence of other conditions and socio-demographic characteristics. The results of this study provide an indication of the relative HRQoL decrements associated with various chronic conditions in the general US adult population. The major limitation of this analysis is the uncertainty of the causal relationship between chronic conditions and HRQoL due to the cross-sectional nature of the study data. In addition, because it was unknown how well the conditions were managed, caution is needed in interpreting study results regarding the relative impact of chronic conditions on HRQoL",10.1185/030079906x132622,1

A comparison with quality of life in the general population,"Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurologic Examination; Pain/psychology; Parkinson Disease/epidemiology/psychology; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Social Adjustment; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom/epidemiology","BACKGROUND: Adequate provision of appropriate healthcare resources for patients with chronic neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) requires knowledge of the impact of the illness on their life. Quality of life (QoL) instruments measure the impact of the disease on general well-being that cannot be fully appreciated by clinical rating scales and allow comparisons with other patient groups and the general population. OBJECTIVES: To assess QoL in a population-based sample of patients with PD in different disease stages in comparison with the general population. METHODS: All 124 patients with PD seen in a population-based study on the prevalence of parkinsonism in the London area were asked to complete a QoL battery including the EuroQoL 5D (EQ-5D), the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF 36), and the 39-item Parkinson's Disease questionnaire (PDQ-39). An interview and complete neurologic examination, including the Hoehn and Yahr scale, were performed on the same day. The patients' QoL scores were compared with published QoL norms from the United Kingdom population. RESULTS: Quality of life, as measured by the PDQ-39, the EQ-5D, and the physical summary of the SF 36, deteriorated significantly with increasing disease severity. The greatest impairment was seen in the areas related to physical and social functioning, whereas reports of pain and poor emotional adjustment had similar prevalence in patients with PD and the general population The impairment of QoL was seen in all age groups and was similar for men and women, but the differences between patients with PD and the general population were most marked in the younger patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease interferes with various aspects of QoL, particularly those related to physical and social functioning. This information should be taken into account in the clinical management and planning and allocation of healthcare resources to this population",10.1002/1531-8257(200011)15:6<1112::aid-mds1008>3.0.co;2-a,1

Recent evidence suggests that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may maintain muscle function. We evaluated the effect of aldosterone blockade on physical performance in functionally impaired older people without heart failure. METHODS: In this parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, community-dwelling participants aged ≥65 years with self-reported problems with activities of daily living were randomized to receive 25 mg spironolactone or identical placebo daily for 20 weeks. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walking distance over 20 weeks. Secondary outcomes were changes in Timed Up and Go test, Incremental Shuttle Walk Test, Functional Limitation Profile, EuroQol EQ-5D, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale over 20 weeks. RESULTS: Participants' mean (standard deviation) age was 75 (6) years. Of the 93% of participants (112/120) who completed the study, 106 remained on medication at 20 weeks. There was no significant difference in change in 6-minute walking distance at 20 weeks between the spironolactone and placebo groups (mean change, -3.2 m; 95% confidence interval, -28.9 to 22.5; P = .81). Quality of life improved significantly at 20 weeks, with an increase in EuroQol EQ-5D score of 0.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.18; P < .01) in the spironolactone group relative to the placebo group. There were no significant differences in between-group change for other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone was well tolerated but did not improve physical function in older people without heart failure. Quality of life improved significantly, and the possible mechanisms for this require further study",10.1016/j.amjmed.2012.11.032,0

Internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty are two common treatment methods but studies comparing the functional outcomes of these procedures in the elderly are limited. This study evaluates the functional outcomes of hip fracture patients treated either with internal fixation or hemiarthroplasty. METHODS: Eighty-six elderly (>60 years) patients who presented with isolated, unstable intertrochanteric fractures between 2009 and 2013 were included in the study. According to the classification of Association for Osteosynthesis/Orthopaedic Trauma Association; 12 of the patients had a 31A1.3 fracture type, 36 of the patients had 31A2.2 and 19 had 31A2.3 fracture type, 12 had 31A3.1 and seven had 31A3.3 fracture. Forty-two of 86 hip patients (Group 1) were treated with intramedullary nailing and antirotator proximal femoral nail implant (TST, Turkey), and 44 (Group 2) were treated with cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Preoperative social function (Jensen) score, EQ-5D index score and mobility (Palmer/Parker) scores were obtained. Five dimensions of EQ-5D were obtained at every follow-up visit until 24 months postoperative. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between two groups according to preoperative demographic variables, including mean age and sex and Jensen, Palmer/Parker,EQ-5D index, five dimensions of EQ-5D and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores. At end of 24 months follow-up, health-related quality of life had increased more in Group 1 and they reported better social functioning and mobility scores (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Internal fixation resulted in better social functioning and mobility scores compared with cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty at the end of 24 months in treatment of unstable pertrochanteric hip fracture in the elderly",10.25011/cim.v38i1.22577,1

The aim of this study is to analyse the differences between the commonly used hypothetical UK value set and the newly introduced Swedish experience-based value set and to evaluate health economic implications of such differences on policy decisions. METHODS: Differences between the two value sets were studied using two methods: a comparison of health states and improvements as well as an empirical comparison. In the comparison of health states and improvements, the valuations of all EQ-5D states and all pure improvements were compared. In the empirical study, a database of 23,925 individuals was used to identify patient groups that could be affected by the implementation of the Swedish experience-based value set. RESULTS: The comparison of health states and possible improvements showed that only three health states were assigned a lower quality-adjusted life year-weight and most improvements were given smaller absolute values if the experience-based value set was used. The empirical comparison showed that severe conditions were assigned higher values when using the experience-based value set. CONCLUSIONS: The Swedish experience-based value set seems to render a higher estimated level of health-related quality of life in virtually all health conditions compared to the hypothetical UK value set. In extension, health-related quality of life enhancing interventions are likely to be given higher priority in decision-making situations where hypothetical values are used to construct quality-adjusted life year-weights. In situations where experience-based quality-adjusted life year-weights are used, life-prolonging interventions would be prioritised",10.1177/1403494815596910,1

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A Dutch cohort of 234 patients with DMT1 was followed for 6 years (1995-2001). HRQOL (RAND-36 and EuroQol) and several demographic and clinical patient characteristics were recorded annually during the study period. Baseline characteristics associated with rate of change in HRQOL were identified using an individual linear growth model. RESULTS: Patients showed a statistically significant decrease over time in most HRQOL scales. Higher baseline diastolic blood pressure was predictive of a faster decrease in RAND-36 PCS score (-0.025, P = .02). Patients with nephropathy showed a faster decrease in PCS (-0.749, P = .003), and those with intermittent claudication a faster decrease in EQ-5D (-0.049, P = .008). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with DMT1, it was possible to identify factors predicting change in HRQOL. Late complications and risk factors for the development and progression of these complications are predictive of a lower HRQOL in the coming years",10.1016/j.jclinepi.2005.02.021,1

Literature data on the quality of life according to the Fontaine stages are very limited. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of Hungarian patients with peripheral arterial disease regarding Fontaine stages II, III and IV. METHODS: The study was based on a cross-sectional survey, which was carried out in four angiologic centres. One hundred and two respondents with peripheral arterial disease (43% woman) were evaluated. The average age of the patients was 70 years (SD-10). RESULTS: Based on the EQ-5D index, the results of the quality of life assessment with respect to Fontaine stages II, III and IV were 0.66, 0.35 and 0.18, respectively. In each stage the EQ-5D values were lower than the values of the age-matched average population. The results of the Pain Visual Analogue Scale (0-100 mm) were 38, 65 and 71 mm in Fontaine stages II, III and IV, respectively, and this showed a strong correlation with the EQ-5D (R = -0.68). In stage Fontaine IV the quality of life of the patients was significantly lower among those who had pain at rest and ALSO ulcer on the leg CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral disease with clinical symptoms causes significant reduction in quality of life which can be measured with EQ-5D. It becomes worse as we move along the Fontaine stages. While measuring the health gain in stage Fontaine IV, the health gain from the reduction of pain in rest and partial recovery from ulcer should be taken into account",10.1556/OH.2013.29567,0

This study describes self-reported physical activity participation among a sample of people with haemophilia B in the US and measures its association with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) Data on 135 participants aged 5-64 years were abstracted from Hemophilia Utilization Group Study Part Vb. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire assessed physical activity among participants aged 15-64 years, and the Children's Physical Activity Questionnaire abstracted from the Canadian Community Health Survey was used for participants aged 5-14 years. SF-12 was used to measure HRQoL and the EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L) was used to measure health status for participants older than 18 years of age. PedsQL was used to measure HRQoL in children aged 5-18 years. Sixty-two percent of participants in the 15-64 year-old age cohort reported a high level of physical activity, 29% reported moderate activity and 9% reported low activity. For children aged 5-14 years, 79% reported participating in physical activity for at least 4 days over a typical week. Based on the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 79% of adults achieved the recommended physical activity level. Multivariable regression models indicated that adults who engaged in a high level of physical activity reported EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores that were 11.7 (P = 0.0726) points greater than those who engaged in moderate/low activity, indicating better health outcomes. Among children, no statistically significant differences in health outcomes were found between high and moderate or low activity groups",10.1111/hae.12485,1

METHODS: Among 430 patients randomized in the PET and Recovery Following Revascularization (PARR)-2 trial to FDG PET-assisted management vs standard, QOL scores were obtained using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) in 427 patients at baseline (FDG PET n = 216; standard n = 211) and 355 patients at 12-month follow-up (FDG PET n = 184; standard n = 171). EQ-5D scores between FDG PET and standard arms were compared using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM). Subgroup analysis compared EQ-5D scores between patients in FDG PET who adhered to PET recommendations (Adherence) vs standard using MMRM. Interaction of revascularization with management was assessed using a general linear model RESULTS: A trend toward higher EQ-5D scores in FDG PET was observed (P = 0.056) Subgroup analysis showed a significant difference favouring adherence (P = 0.04) Higher QOL at 6 months for FDG PET (P = 0.02) and Adherence (P = 0.02) were observed. For revascularization, an interaction with management (FDG PET vs standard) for QOL was observed (6 months: P = 0.01; 12 months: P = 0.1); Adherence (6 months: P = 0.01; 12 months: P = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET-directed management improves QOL, at least in the short-term and with adherence to recommendations. This may relate to revascularization, and may indicate better treatment selection using FDG PET",10.1016/j.cjca.2011.09.012,1

In this substudy, we evaluated the effect of these treatment modalities on the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and symptom burden of patients at 12 and 24 months. METHODS AND RESULTS: During the study period, 294 patients were enrolled in the MANTRA-PAF trial and randomized to receive AAD (N = 148) or RFA (N = 146). Two generic questionnaires were used to assess the HRQoL [Short Form-36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-five dimensions (EQ-5D)], and the Arrhythmia-Specific questionnaire in Tachycardia and Arrhythmia (ASTA) was used to evaluate the symptoms appearing during the trial. All comparisons were made on an intention-to-treat basis. Both randomization groups showed significant improvements in assessments with both SF-36 and EQ-5D, at 24 months. Patients randomized to RFA showed significantly greater improvement in four physically related scales of the SF-36. The three most frequently reported symptoms were breathlessness during activity, pronounced tiredness, and worry/anxiety. In both groups, there was a significant reduction in ASTA symptom index and in the severity of seven of the eight symptoms over time. CONCLUSION: Both AAD and RFA as first-line treatment resulted in substantial improvement of HRQoL and symptom burden in patients with PAF Patients randomized to RFA showed greater improvement in physical scales (SF-36) and the EQ-visual analogue scale.

Evidence from two randomised trials with afatinib,"Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy; Afatinib; Disease-Free Survival; Health Status; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Quality of Life; Quinazolines/therapeutic use; Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors; Treatment Outcome; ONCOLOGY","OBJECTIVE: Progression-free survival (PFS) is frequently used as an efficacy end point in oncology clinical trials. However, there is limited evidence to support a positive association between improvement in PFS and improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The association between PFS and HRQoL was evaluated in two randomised trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from two randomised controlled trials in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; LUX-Lung 1 and LUX-Lung 3) were used to investigate HRQoL in patients to determine whether tumour progression is accompanied by worsening HRQoL. HRQoL was assessed using the cancer-specific European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire QLQ-C30, the EuroQol EQ-5D overall utility and EuroQol EQ visual analogue scale. In both studies, progression was evaluated by independent review using RECIST criteria (primary end point) and also by investigator assessment. The relationship between tumour progression and HRQoL was evaluated using analysis of covariance and a longitudinal model RESULTS: Compliance with HRQoL questionnaire completion was high. In both studies, patients with progression consistently experienced numerically poorer HRQoL at the time of progression than patients without progression. Differences in mean scores were statistically significant (p<0.05) between patients with and without progression at week 4 in all analyses in LUX-Lung 1 and at multiple time points in LUX-Lung 3. Results from the longitudinal analysis showed that progression (by independent review and investigator assessment) appears to have consistent negative impact on all three HRQoL measures (all p<0.0001) CONCLUSIONS: Tumour progression in patients with NSCLC was associated with statistically significant worsening in HRQoL. These findings confirm the value of PFS as a patient-relevant end point",10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005762,0

Illness perceptions are determinants of quality of life (QoL). Factors contributing to persisting impaired QoL after Cushing's syndrome (CS) remain largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore illness perceptions, as potentially modifiable psychological factors, in relation to QoL in patients with long-term remission of CS. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We included patients with long-term remission of CS (n=52). Illness perceptions were evaluated using the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ)-Revised, and QoL was measured using the physical symptom checklist, EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D), and the CushingQoL. Reference data were derived from recent studies and included patients with vestibular schwannoma (n=80), acute (n=35) or chronic (n=63) pain, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n=171). RESULTS: Illness perceptions showed a strong correlation with QoL Patients with CS scored distinctively more negative on the IPQ compared with patients with vestibular schwannoma and patients with acute pain, and also reported more illness-related complaints (all P<0.01). There were also some differences in illness perceptions between patients with CS and patients with chronic pain and patients with COPD, but there was no distinct pattern CONCLUSIONS: Patients after long-term remission of CS report more negative illness perceptions compared with patients with other acute or chronic conditions. Further research is needed to assess whether QoL in CS can be improved by addressing these illness perceptions, for example, by a self-management intervention program",10.1530/EJE-11-0307,1

The main interpretation strategy for these health related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaires is the use of population based reference values. This study aims to obtain the population based norms for the Spanish version of SF-12 version 2 (SF-12v2), to evaluate its construct validity and to compare the scores obtained by the standard and the specific method of calculation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a subsample of the Catalan Health Interview Survey (n=4,261), representative of the general non-institutionalized population. Median and percentiles were calculated for each of the 8 dimensions and for the component summaries, stratified by sex and age groups. The construct validity was evaluated by comparing known groups, applying ANOVA. RESULTS: The results for the known groups analysis supported the hypothesis established a priori (P<.001): worse physical health for persons with mobility problems (EQ-5D) (37.8 vs 52), with restriction in activities (41.8 vs 51.2), and with greater number of chronic disorders (from 43.2 to 53.9); and worse mental health with problems of anxiety/depression (EQ-5D) (42.2 vs 51.9). The scores obtained by the 2 different methods of calculation were similar, except for General Health and Vitality CONCLUSIONS: The SF-12v2 is a valid instrument to measure HQRL in our environment. The obtained norms facilitate the interpretation of SF-12v2 scores in the clinical practice, research and health policy. We recommend the use of the specific method of calculation for national HRQL comparison and the standard one for international comparison",10.1016/j.medcli.2011.10.024,0

They provide a means of comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. We present detailed disease-outcome trees and EQ-5D scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the United States (Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli non-O157, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella, Toxoplasma gondii, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera Vibrio, and Yersinia enterocolitica). We estimate over 5800 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of L monocytogenes and V. vulnificus, compared to 125 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of T gondii, 26 for E. coli O157:H7, 16 for Salmonella and Campylobacter, and 14 for Y. enterocolitica. The remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 QALYs lost per 1000 cases. In total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in QALY loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total QALY loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. These estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. This study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens",10.1089/fpd.2013.1658,0

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either low-dose 7-day buprenorphine patches (patch strengths of 5, 10, and 20 microg/h, with a maximum dosage of 20 microg/h) or twice-daily prolonged-release tramadol tablets (tablet strengths of 75, 100, 150, and 200 mg, with a maximum dosage of 400 mg/d) over a 12-week open-label treatment period. Supplementary paracetamol was available as rescue medication throughout the study. The primary end point was the difference in BS-11 scores from baseline to the completion of treatment. Noninferiority was assumed if the treatment difference on the BS-11 scale was -1.5 boxes, indicating a clinically meaningful result. Secondary efficacy variables were rescue medication use, sleep disturbance and quality of sleep, and patients' and investigators' global assessments of pain relief. In addition, patient preference was assessed at the completion visit by asking patients whether, given equal pain relief, they would prefer basic treatment for OA pain with a patch applied once weekly or a tablet taken twice daily Exploratory variables included investigators' assessments of patients' pain, stiffness, and ability to perform daily activities (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index); patients' quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D health states index and EuroQol visual analog scale); and abuse and diversion of study drug. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients (69 receiving 7-day buprenorphine patches and 65 receiving tramadol tablets) were randomized and received >or=1 dose of study medication. A respective 98.6% and 100% of the 2 treatment groups were white, with mean (SD) ages of 64.4 (11.1) and 64.2 (9.3) years. Both treatments were associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in pain from baseline to study completion. The least squares mean change from baseline in BS-11 scores in the 7-day buprenorphine patch and tramadol tablet groups was -2.26 (95% CI, -2.76 to -1.76) and -2.09 (95% CI, -2.61 to -1.58). The efficacy of 7-day buprenorphine patches was noninferior to that of prolonged-release tramadol tablets. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was comparable in the 2 treatment groups: 226 AEs were reported in 61 patients (88.4%) in the 7-day buprenorphine patch group, and 152 AEs were reported in 51 patients (78.5%) in the tramadol group. Ten patients (14.5%) in the 7-day buprenorphine patch group and 19 (29.2%) in the tramadol tablet group withdrew from the study due to AEs. The most common AEs in the 7-day buprenorphine patch group were nausea (30.4%), constipation (18.8%), and dizziness (15.9%); the most common AEs in the tramadol tablet group were nausea (24.6%), fatigue (18.5%), and pain (12.3%). Most patients (47/67 [70.1%] in the 7-day buprenorphine patch group and 43/61 [70.5%] in the tramadol tablet group) reported that they would prefer a 7-day patch to a twice-daily tablet for future pain treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with chronic, moderate to severe OA pain of the hip and/or knee, 7-day low-dose buprenorphine patches were an effective and well-tolerated analgesic. The buprenorphine patches were noninferior to prolonged-release tramadol tablets. European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials number: 2006-003233-32",10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.03.001,0

METHODS: Data was extracted from the Health Survey for England (HSE), 2005. The HSE is a series of annual cross-sectional surveys designed to describe the health of people living in private homes in England, from a random sample of 720 postcode sectors. Interviewees were ≥ 16 years. Pain severity was characterised by the EQ-5D. Socioeconomic status was classified by ability to work, social security benefits, the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). RESULTS: Pain status was recorded for 9419 subjects of whom 431 (4.6%) reported severe pain. 156 of those reporting severe pain were of working age. Of these 68 (43.6%) stated they were unable to work due to sickness or disability and 64 (41.0%) claimed a state benefit. After adjusting for disease and demographic variables, severe pain was associated with the IMD with an odds ratio of 1.65 (95% CI 1.16-2.34, p=0.005), NS-SEC (OR=2.94; 95% CI 1.76-4.91) and equivalised household income (lowest versus highest quintile; OR=2.58 (95% CI 1.46-4.57, p=0.001) CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant associations between pain and socio-economic disadvantage.

Testing the influence of perspective in valuing EQ-5D-Y,Adult; Child Health/trends; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Children; EQ-5D; EQ-5D-Y; Valuation of health,"PURPOSE: To test whether or not adults assign the same values to hypothetical health states that describe health in adults as when those same descriptions refer to the health of a child. METHODS: A two-part self-completion questionnaire was designed in which respondents were asked firstly to rate a fixed set of EQ-5D-Y health states on a 0-100 visual analogue scale as if they themselves were in these states. Two versions of the questionnaire were produced each with a different second part. One version instructed respondents to value the same states but to imagine them describing another adult. The second version required respondents to value these states as if they applied to a 10-year-old child Questionnaires were distributed to adults recruited in three countries (Germany, Spain and England) using convenience sampling methods. RESULTS: A total of 1085 questionnaires were completed. Despite some significant differences in the characteristics of the achieved samples in the three countries involved, the rank order of health states was largely consistent across each adult/child reference perspective. In all countries, the mean values were lower when health states described children rather than adults. Significant differences were found for 16/24 states when values for those states applied to adult respondent themselves were compared with the values for those states applied to a 10-year-old child. A near-uniform pattern was found across all three countries in which health state values for children were found to be lower than for adults. CONCLUSIONS: Values for health states when ascribed to adults are higher than when those same states are associated with children. Were EQ-5D-3L values for adults applied to EQ-5D-Y health states, then this would effectively lead to an misrepresentation of the value assigned to a health status in children",10.1007/s11136-015-0971-1,1

Acupuncture has been traditionally sought as a treatment for FD. The aim of this study is to investigate whether acupuncture treatment helps improve symptoms of FD. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-center, randomized, waitlist-controlled trial will be carried out to evaluate whether acupuncture treatment improves FD symptoms. Seventy six participants aged 18 to 75 years with FD as diagnosed by Rome III criteria will be recruited from August 2013 to January 2014 at two Korean Medicine hospitals. They will be randomly allocated either into eight sessions of partially individualized acupuncture treatment over 4 weeks or a waitlist group. The acupuncture group will then be followed-up for 3 weeks with six telephone visits and a final visit will be paid at 8 weeks. The waitlist group will receive the identical acupuncture treatment after a 4-week waiting period. The primary outcome is the proportion of responders with adequate symptom relief and the secondary outcomes include Nepean dyspepsia index, EQ-5D, FD-related quality of life, Beck's depression inventory, state-trait anxiety inventory questionnaire, and level of ghrelin hormone. The protocol was approved by the participating centers' Institutional Review Boards. DISCUSSION: Results of this trial will help clarify not only whether the acupuncture treatment is beneficial for symptom improvement in FD patients but also to elucidate the related mechanisms of how acupuncture might work.

METHODS: Singapore English and Chinese OKS versions were cross-culturally adapted from the source English version following standard guidelines (including cognitive debriefing), and validated by interviewing patients in English or Chinese using an identical, pretested questionnaire containing the OKS, Short Form 36, and EQ-5D. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, dimensionality using principal component factor analysis and item-total correlations, convergent and divergent construct validity by assessing six and three a priori hypotheses, respectively. RESULTS: The Singapore English and Chinese OKS were well accepted by patients in pilot testing. When administered to a consecutive sample of 127 English and 131 Chinese-speaking Singaporeans with knee OA (mean age 66 years, 83% female, mean duration of OA 6 years, Chinese:Malay:Indian:Others=78:7.9:11:3.1% for English version), Cronbach's alpha exceeded 0.8 and factor analysis yielded three factors for both versions. Hypothesized item-total correlations (Spearman's rho > or = 0.4) were observed for all items except limping, kneeling, and night knee pain in both versions. Convergent construct validity was supported by the presence of hypothesized moderate/strong correlations (rho=0.37-0.73) for six and five a priori hypotheses in English and Chinese versions, respectively. Divergent construct validity was supported by the presence of weak correlations (rho=0.09-0.30) for all three a priori hypotheses in both versions. CONCLUSION: Singapore English and Chinese OKS demonstrated good patient acceptability and psychometric properties (including construct validity) among multiethnic Asian patients with knee OA undergoing TKR",10.1016/j.joca.2007.02.013,0

METHODS: This new screening tool was designed to detect Japanese individuals under high-risk conditions who may soon require care services because of problems of the locomotive organs. Content validity, construct validity, criterion validity, internal-consistency reliability, and reproducibility (test-retest reliability) were examined using psychometric analysis, and a cutoff score to detect locomotive syndrome was determined. To investigate construct validity of the GLFS-25 and determine the cutoff score, the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) were used. RESULTS: Study 1 analyzed 711 Japanese elderly people ≥65 years old. No floor or ceiling effects were included in the GLFS-25. Internal consistency was confirmed by a Cronbach's α reliability coefficient of 0.961. As for the association between the GLFS-25 and European Quality of Life Scale-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.85 (P < 0.001), showing excellent concurrent validity of the GLFS-25 Categorical principal component analysis showed that the construct structure consisted of one item cluster or the GLFS-25 was unifactorial. The AIC showed that one cluster of seven items was located in the center, with significant associations with the other five clusters. In study 2, 205 individuals were analyzed, and the test-retest interclass correlation was satisfactory (range 0.712-0.924). The cutoff score for identifying locomotive syndrome was set at 16 Validity and reliability of this new measurement were psychometrically confirmed as sufficient. CONCLUSIONS: The GLFS-25 offers a valid and reliable questionnaire scale for detecting locomotive syndrome in elderly Japanese individuals",10.1007/s00776-011-0193-5,0

DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 46 patients, diagnosed with N-TOS between 1999 and 2008. Twenty-four operated and 22 conservatively treated patients were sent questionnaires on their current symptoms and QoL. A matched control group (n = 24) of healthy individuals was selected for QoL comparison. Statistics were performed with linear and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed a significant QoL difference between the three groups (p = 0.001). Separate analysis between groups demonstrated that all patients with N-TOS-like symptoms have a lower QoL than healthy controls (p = 0.001 resp. p  < or =  0.000). No difference was found between conservatively and surgically treated patients (p = 0.26). EQ-5D response rate was 83%. Of the 24 surgically treated patients, 15 would choose surgery again in a similar situation, although 4 did not benefit in terms of symptom reduction. Symptom relief and VAS pain scores in the conservatively and surgically treated patients did not show significant differences (p = 0.95 resp. p = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: All patients with N-TOS have a significantly decreased QoL compared with healthy individuals, regardless of the type of therapy they received. In this small study, surgical decompression fails to improve QoL in patients with N-TOS to the level measured in the healthy control group, despite symptom reduction consistent with previous reports Variables significantly associated with outcome were duration of symptoms and localisation (variables included in the prediction model: age, sex, duration of symptoms, presence of paraesthesias, localisation, Adson's, Wright's and Roos' test, history of trauma, cervical arthrosis). In the perspective of QoL, the benefit of decompressive surgery is questionable. Improving patient selection seems imperative in order to achieve better results in our surgically treated patients",10.3109/02688697.2010.489656,1

This paper reports the results of a research project undertaken in 2007 that sought to reduce and refine a longer survey in order to provide a summary measure of wellbeing and capability in the realm of public health. The reduction and refinement of the questionnaire took place across a number of stages, using both qualitative (five focus group discussions and 17 in-depth interviews) and quantitative (secondary data analysis, N = 1048 and primary data collection using postal surveys and interviews, N = 45) approaches. The questionnaire was reduced from its original 60+ questions to 24 questions (including demographic questions). Each of Nussbaum's ten Central Human Capabilities are measured using one (or more) of the 18 specific capability items which are included in the questionnaire (referred to as the OCAP-18). Analysis of the questionnaire responses (N = 198) found that respondents differed with respect to the levels of capabilities they reported, and that these capabilities appear to be sensitive to one's gender, age, income and deprivation decile. An index of capability, estimated by assuming equal weight for each capability question, found that the average level of capability amongst respondents was 12.44 (range 3-17.75). This index was found to be highly correlated with a measure of health (EQ-5D) and wellbeing (global QoL), although some differences were apparent. This project operationalised the capability approach to produce an instrument to measure the effectiveness (and cost effectiveness) of public health interventions; the resulting OCAP-18 appears to be responsive and measure something supplementary to health and wellbeing, thus offers a promising addition to the current suite of outcome measures that are available",10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.002,1

Multiple psychiatric symptoms (MPS) have many negative effects on quality of life of the patient as well as on caregiver burden and competence. Irrespective of the effectiveness of an intervention programme, it is important to take into account its economic aspects. METHODS: The economic evaluation was performed alongside a single open RCT and conducted between 2001 and 2006. The patients who met the selection criteria were asked to participate in the RCT. After the patient or his caregiver signed a written informed consent form, he was then randomly assigned to either IRR or UC.The costs and effects of IRR were compared to those of UC. We assessed the cost-utility of IRR as well as the cost-effectiveness of both conditions. Primary outcome variable: severity of MPS (NPI) of patients; secondary outcome variables: general caregiver burden (CB) and caregiver competence (CCL), quality of life (EQ5D) of the patient, and total medical costs per patient (TiC-P). Cost-utility was evaluated on the basis of differences in total medical costs). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by comparing differences of total medical costs and effects on NPI, CB and CCL (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio: ICER). CEAC-analyses were performed for QALY and NPI-severity. All significant testing was fixed at p<0.05 (two-tailed) The data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT)-principle. A complete cases approach (CC) was used. RESULTS: IRR turned out to be non-significantly, 10.5% more expensive than UC (€ 36 per day). The number of QALYs was 0.01 higher (non-significant) in IRR, resulting in € 276,290 per QALY According to the ICER-method, IRR was significantly more cost-effective on NPI-sum-severity of the patient (up to 34%), CB and CCL (up to 50%), with ICERs varying from € 130 to € 540 per additional point of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were found on QALYs. In IRR patients improved significantly more on severity of MPS, and caregivers on general burden and competence, with incremental costs varying from € 130 to € 540 per additional point of improvement. The surplus costs of IRR are considered acceptable, taking into account the high societal costs of suffering from MPS of psychogeriatric patients and the high burden of caregivers. The large discrepancy in economic evaluation between QALYs (based on EQ5D) and ICERs (based on clinically relevant outcomes) demands further research on the validity of EQ5D in psychogeriatric cost-utility studies.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a 12-month home-exercise program for older adults after hospitalization. METHOD: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial. The analysis was conducted from the health and community service provider perspective. A total of 340 people aged 60 years and older, with a recent hospital admission, were randomized into exercise and usual care control groups. Incremental costs per extra person showing improvement in mobility performance (using the Short Physical Performance Battery), per person indicating improvement in health (self-reported using a 3-point Likert scale) and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (utility measured using the EQ-5D) were estimated. Uncertainty was represented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Subgroup analyses for participants with better cognition (above the median MMSE score of 28) also were undertaken RESULTS: The average cost of the intervention was $A751 per participant. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the program relative to usual care was $A22,958 per extra person showing an improvement in mobility, $A19,020 per extra person indicating an improvement in health, and $A77,403 per QALY. The acceptability curve demonstrates that the intervention had an 80% probability of being cost-effective relative to the control at a threshold of $A48,000 per extra person achieving mobility improvement and $A36,000 indicating an improvement in self-reported health. There was no threshold value at which the program can be considered as having an 80% probability of cost-effectiveness for the QALY outcome. Subgroup analyses for participants with better cognitive status indicated improved cost-effectiveness for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: The exercise intervention appeared to offer reasonable value for money for mobility outcomes and self-reported health status. Value for money for all measures was greater in the higher cognitive status subgroup",10.1016/j.jamda.2015.01.075,1

DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in 2002. SETTING: General practices in the Hunter Region, New South Wales, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty general practitioners recruited 849 patients to participate in the study. INTERVENTION: Education (academic detailing, provision of prescribing information and feedback); medication risk assessment; facilitation of medication review; financial incentives. PRIMARY MEASURES: a composite score reflecting use of benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thiazide diuretics; secondary measures: use of medication reviews, occurrence of falls, quality of life (as assessed by SF-12 and EQ-5D survey scores. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, participants in the intervention group had increased odds of having an improved medication use composite score (odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-2.85) at 4-month follow-up but not at 12 months. At 4-month follow-up, the intervention group had reduced odds of using NSAIDs (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.99) and showed a non-significant reduction in use of benzodiazepines (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20-1.30) and thiazide diuretics (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.48-1.01) Changes in drug use were not significant at 12-month follow-up. At 12 months, intervention-group participants had lower adjusted ORs (AORs) for having a fall (AOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91), injury (AOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.96), and injury requiring medical attention (AOR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.70). Quality-of-life scores were unaffected by the intervention. CONCLUSION: Education and systems for medication review conducted by GPs can be used to improve use of medicines.

The 12-month interim outcomes of the first 172 included patients are presented here. RESULTS: There were reductions of mean daily ""Off"" time from baseline (BL) (7.1 ± 3.5 h) and ""On"" time with dyskinesias (5.2 ± 4.5 h) at month 12 (M12) of -4.7 ± 3.4 and -1.7 ± 5.0 h respectively (p < 0.0001; p = 0.0228). UPDRS II and III ""On"" scores decreased from BL to M12 (p = 0.0107 and p = 0.0128). Total NMSS and PDQ-8 scores improved at M12 (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0100). Mean LCIG dose administered through PEG at first visit (day after implantation) was 1304 ± 618 mg/day and remained stable through M12. Continuous LCIG infusion tolerability and adverse drug reactions were consistent with the known safety profile of previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: This observational, routine-care study supports long-term safety and efficacy of LCIG infusion in advanced PD including motor, non-motor and QoL improvements",10.1016/j.parkreldis.2014.12.012,0

Both of them were the primary objectives of the PANORAMA (NCT00916513) study. Metabolic control, treatment patterns, and management by healthcare professionals were also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study randomly recruited>40 year-old patients with T2DM from Spanish healthcare centers. HbA1c was measured using the same technique in all patients, who also completed quality of life (EQ-5D and ADDQoL) and treatment satisfaction (DTSQ) questionnaires and the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS-II). RESULTS: Fifty-four investigators recruited 751 patients, 60.3% of whom had HbA1c levels <7% Approximately 25% of patients on monotherapy had HbA1c values ≥ 7%, Patients with longer disease duration and more complex treatments, especially with insulin, showed the poorer control. Despite good overall treatment satisfaction (mean 29.3±6.1, 0 to 36-point scale), patients with a poorer metabolic control, previous hypoglycemia episodes, and more complex therapies had a worse QoL and a greater fear of suffering hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in metabolic control, there are still areas to improve. Early addition of safe drugs to monotherapy would help achieve control objectives without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, and delaying the start of insulin therapy. This would also improve QoL and treatment satisfaction",10.1016/j.endonu.2013.05.005,0
14042,The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of minimal access surgery amongst people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease - a UK collaborative study. The REFLUX trial,"Adult; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Fundoplication/methods; Gastroesophageal Reflux/drug therapy/surgery; Gastrointestinal Agents/economics/therapeutic use; Health Resources/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Laparoscopy/economics; Male; Middle Aged; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures/economics; Models, Econometric; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Surveys and Questionnaires; Technology Assessment, Biomedical; Treatment Outcome","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of a policy of relatively early laparoscopic surgery compared with continued medical management amongst people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) judged suitable for both policies. DESIGN: Relative clinical effectiveness was assessed by a randomised trial (with parallel non-randomised preference groups) comparing a laparoscopic surgery-based policy with a continued medical management policy. The economic evaluation compared the cost-effectiveness of the two management policies in order to identify the most efficient provision of future care and describe the resource impact that various policies for fundoplication would have on the NHS. SETTING: A total of 21 hospitals throughout the UK with a local partnership between surgeon(s) and gastroenterologist(s) who shared the secondary care of patients with GORD. PARTICIPANTS: The 810 participants, who were identified retrospectively or prospectively via their participating clinicians, had both documented evidence of GORD (endoscopy and/or manometry/24-hour pH monitoring) and symptoms for longer than 12 months. In addition, the recruiting clinician(s) was clinically uncertain about which management policy was best. INTERVENTION: Of the 810 eligible patients who consented to participate, 357 were recruited to the randomised arm of the trial (178 allocated to surgical management, 179 allocated to continued, but optimised, medical management) and 453 recruited to the parallel non-randomised preference arm (261 chose surgical management, 192 chose to continue with best medical management). The type of fundoplication was left to the discretion of the surgeon. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed a baseline REFLUX questionnaire, developed specifically for this study, containing a disease-specific outcome measure, the Short Form with 36 Items (SF-36), the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and the Beliefs about Medicines and Surgery questionnaires (BMQ/BSQ). Postal questionnaires were completed at participant-specific time intervals after joining the trial (equivalent to approximately 3 and 12 months after surgery). Intraoperative data were recorded by the surgeons and all other in-hospital data were collected by the research nurse. At the end of the study period, participants completed a discrete choice experiment questionnaire. RESULTS: The randomised groups were well balanced at entry. Participants had been taking GORD medication for a median of 32 months; the mean age of participants was 46 years and 66% were men. Of 178 randomised to surgery, 111 (62%) actually had fundoplication. There was a mixture of clinical and personal reasons why some patients did not have surgery, sometimes related to long waiting times. A total or partial wrap procedure was performed depending on surgeon preference. Complications were uncommon and there were no deaths associated with surgery. By the equivalent of 12 months after surgery, 38% in the randomised surgical group (14% amongst those who had surgery) were taking reflux medication compared with 90% in the randomised medical group. There were substantial differences (one-third to one-half standard deviation) favouring the randomised surgical group across the health status measures, the size depending on assumptions about the proportion that actually had fundoplication. These differences were the same or somewhat smaller than differences observed at 3 months. The lower the REFLUX score, the worse the symptoms at trial entry and the larger the benefit observed after surgery. The preference surgical group had the lowest REFLUX scores at baseline. These scores improved substantially after surgery, and by 12 months they were better than those in the preference medical group. The BMQ/BSQ and discrete choice experiment did distinguish the preference groups from each other and from the randomised groups. The latter indicated that the risk of serious complications was the most important single attribute of a treatment option. A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the surgery policy was more costly (mean 2049 pounds) but also more effective [+0.088 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)]. The estimated incremental cost per QALY was 19,000-23,000 pounds, with a probability between 46% (when 62% received surgery) and 19% (when all received surgery) of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY. Modelling plausible longer-term scenarios (such as lifetime benefit after surgery) indicated a greater likelihood (74%) of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of 20,000 pounds, but applying a range of alternative scenarios indicated wide uncertainty. The expected value of perfect information was greatest for longer-term quality of life and proportions of surgical patients requiring medication. CONCLUSIONS: Amongst patients requiring long-term medication to control symptoms of GORD, surgical management significantly increases general and reflux-specific health-related quality of life measures, at least up to 12 months after surgery. Complications of surgery were rare. A surgical policy is, however, more costly than continued medical management. At a threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY it may well be cost-effective, especially when putative longer-term benefits are taken into account, but this is uncertain. The more troublesome the symptoms, the greater the potential benefit from surgery. Uncertainty about cost-effectiveness would be greatly reduced by more reliable information about relative longer-term costs and benefits of surgical and medical policies. This could be through extended follow-up of the REFLUX trial cohorts or of other cohorts of fundoplication patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN15517081",10.3310/hta12310,1

METHODS: Twelve semi-structured interviews and five focus group discussions were conducted with participants of a randomized controlled trial (n=52) evaluating the effectiveness of a theory-based lifestyle intervention in Dutch adults at risk for diabetes mellitus and/or cardiovascular disease. Transcripts were analysed by two independent researchers using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: In total we identified twelve non-health outcome themes that were important from the participant perspective. Four of these were reported as direct outcomes of the lifestyle intervention and eight were reported as consequences of lifestyle behaviour change. Our findings also suggest that lifestyle behaviour change may have spillover effects to other people in the participants' direct environment. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that in the context of lifestyle behaviour change EQ5D based QALYs capture health promotion outcomes only partially. More insights are needed into non-health outcomes and spillover effects produced by health promotion in other contexts and how participants and society value these. Methods to account for these outcomes within an economic evaluation framework need to be developed and tested",10.1016/j.healthpol.2012.04.005,1

AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the measurement properties of two disease-specific and generic questionnaires: the Obesity-related Well-Being (ORWELL97), the Obesity-Related Disability test (TSD-OC), the EuroQoL, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. MATERIALS/SUBJECTS: Two-hundreds and forty-nine obese inpatients [age 47 (standard deviation, SD 15) years, body mass index 44.4 (SD 5.2) kg/m(2), 69 % female] completed the four questionnaires before and after a 3-week multidisciplinary weight reduction program. Standard measurement properties were calculated and compared. RESULTS: Intra-class correlation coefficient ranged from 0.73 to 0.90 for most of the instruments and subscales. The standard error of measurement ranged from 9 to 21 % for the generic instruments, and from 9 to 44 % for the specific questionnaires. Missing data and ceiling effects were found for TSD-OC. Responsiveness was similar for all the instruments. The correlations between the change scores of the instruments were small (<0.37). CONCLUSIONS: It was not possible to identify a ""best"" instrument, but overall the ORWELL97 seems to show better measurement properties. The two specific instruments measured different constructs and they did not show a clear superior performance compared to the generic questionnaires",10.1007/s40618-013-0010-4,1

METHODS: A 70  yr old male, diagnosed with PD 7 years prior to study enrolment, self-administered CVS at home 2×20 minutes per day for three months using a solid-state portable device. Standardised neuropsychological assessments of motor, cognitive, affective and independent function were carried out prior to stimulation, at the start and end of the sham (month 1) and active (months 2-3) phases, and 5 months post-stimulation. RESULTS: Relative to the pre-stimulation baseline, behavioural improvements that exceeded the minimal detectable change were observed on the EQ5D, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Schwab and England scale, 2 minute walk, Timed up and go, Non-motor symptom assessment scale for PD, Montreal cognitive assessment, Hospital depression scale and Epworth sleepiness scale. The level of change exceeded the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference on all scales for which a threshold has been published. By contrast, little improvement was seen during the sham (i.e., placebo) phase. CONCLUSION: Caloric vestibular stimulation may offer a novel, home-based method of relieving everyday symptoms of PD, and merits further evaluative study",10.3233/NRE-161308,1

The aim of this study was to quantify these effects using validated HRQL questionnaires. DESIGN: A cross-sectional follow-up study was carried out in GO patients who had started radiotherapy and/or prednisone treatment between 1982 and 1992. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2000 these patients received an HRQL questionnaire containing the SF-36, EuroQol and GO-QOL questionnaires. All patients were invited for a follow-up ophthalmological examination. HRQL scores of the respondents were compared with those of two reference populations of 'healthy' persons and to scores of several other GO populations. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-eight patients were included; 163 completed the HRQL questionnaire and 154 visited the outpatient clinic. The median follow-up was 11.7 years. A considerable number of symptoms related to GO were found. More than half of the patients had diplopia and 28% had a low visual acuity. Sixty per cent had a proptosis of at least 20 mm. The HRQL scores were considerably better than those of newly diagnosed GO patients (untreated) and GO patients who completed the questionnaire during treatment, but worse than those of 'healthy' persons. Although we did not perform a longitudinal study, we included a selected group of patients who had been treated with radiotherapy and/or prednisone in the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam, and though we could not assess HRQL at comparable times after receiving treatment, this is the first study that presents any data on the long-term effects of GO on HRQL. CONCLUSION: GO has a marked negative effect on HRQL, even many years after treatment. These findings suggest that GO should be considered a chronic disease. Aftercare is needed for these patients after their immunosuppressive and surgical treatments",10.1530/eje.0.1460751,1

We report the cross-cultural validation results of the LupusPRO English-language version among Filipino SLE patients. METHOD: The 43-item LupusPRO was pretested in 15 SLE individuals, then administered to 106 SLE patients, along with short-form SF36 and the EQ5D visual analogue scale. A mail/drop-back LupusPRO and change in health status item survey were returned within two to three days. Demographics, clinical and serological characteristics, disease activity and damage measured by PGA, SELENA-SLEDAI, LFA Flare, and SLICC-ACR SLE damage index (SDI) were collected. Internal consistency reliability (ICR), test-retest reliability (TRT), convergent validity (corresponding SF36 domains) and criterion validity (against general health and disease activity measures) were tested. Reported p values are two tailed. RESULTS: A total of 121 Filipino SLE subjects (95% women, median age 31.0 ± 16 years) with at least a high school level of English instruction participated. Median (IQR) PGA, SLEDAI and SDI were 0.0 (1.0), 2.0 (10) and 0 (1), respectively. ICR exceeded 0.7 for all domains except the lupus symptoms domain. TRT was greater than 0.85 for all LupusPRO domains. Convergent and criterion validity were observed against corresponding SF36 domains and disease activity measures. The tool was well received by patients. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good fit. CONCLUSION: English LupusPRO has fair psychometric properties among SLE patients in the Philippines, and is now available for inclusion in clinical trials and longitudinal studies to test responsiveness to change",10.1177/0961203312474086,0

METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial the cost-effectiveness of LDN versus mini-incision open donor nephrectomy (ODN) was determined. Fifty donors were included in each group. All in-hospital costs were documented. Postoperatively, case record forms were sent to the donors during 1-year follow-up to record return-to-work and societal costs. To offset costs against quality of life, the Euroqol-5D questionnaire was administered preoperatively and 3, 7, 14, 28, 90, 180, and 365 days postoperatively. RESULTS: Mean total costs were euro6,090 (US$7,308) after LDN and euro4,818 ($5,782) after ODN (P<0.001). Disposables influenced the cost difference most. Mean productivity loss was 68 and 75 days after LDN and ODN respectively, corresponding to euro783 ($940) gained per donor after LDN. The main gain in quality of life in the LDN group was realized within 4 weeks postoperatively. LDN resulted in a mean gain of 0.03 quality-adjusted life years at mean costs of euro1,271 ($1,525) and euro488 ($586) from a healthcare perspective and a societal perspective, respectively This implies that one additional Quality-Adjusted Life Year after LDN costs about euro16,000 ($19,200) from a societal point of view and about euro41,000 ($49,200) from a health-care perspective. Activities other than work were resumed significantly earlier after LDN (66 vs. 91 days, P=0.01). CONCLUSION: In addition to a clinically relevant donor-experienced benefit from LDN, this technique appeared, given a societal perspective, a cost-efficient procedure mainly due to less productivity losses",10.1097/01.tp.0000267149.64831.08,1

It may affect several aspects of life, especially the quality of life (QoL). Hence, this study was conducted to establish an understanding of pain and its correlates and effects on patients with SCI in our community. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 58 male veterans suffering from SCI were admitted to our center for a regular follow-up. Demographic and SCI-related descriptive information were gathered using a self-reported questionnaire. To evaluate the patients' pain quality and the effect of pain on daily life, a questionnaire in 3 parts of lumbar, cervical and shoulder pain was administered. EuroQoL questionnaire and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 12 were also used to assess the patients' QoL. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 45.91 ± 6.69 with mean injury time of 25.54 ± 5.91. forty-four patients (75.9%) reported pain, including lumbar pain (63%), cervical pain (39%) and shoulder pain (51%). The presence of pain was associated with lower QoL. Patients with lumbar pain reported a significant amount of pain affecting their daily life and this effect was higher in patients with lower GHQ score or anxiety/depressive disorder CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain, is a common complaint in veterans with SCI and is inversely associated with functioning and general health status. Lumbar and shoulder pain affects patient's daily living more than cervical pain",10.3344/kjp.2015.28.2.129,1
14948,Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN)--prospective validation of risk prediction models for adult patients with acute traumatic brain injury to use to evaluate the optimum location and comparative costs of neurocritical care: a cohort study,"Acute Disease; Adult; Age Factors; Brain Injuries/economics/rehabilitation; Cohort Studies; Costs and Cost Analysis; Critical Care; Female; Glasgow Coma Scale; Glasgow Outcome Scale; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; Patient Transfer/economics/statistics & numerical data; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Adjustment/methods; Time Factors; United Kingdom","OBJECTIVES: To validate risk prediction models for acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to use the best model to evaluate the optimum location and comparative costs of neurocritical care in the NHS. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Sixty-seven adult critical care units. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to critical care following actual/suspected TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 15. INTERVENTIONS: Critical care delivered in a dedicated neurocritical care unit, a combined neuro/general critical care unit within a neuroscience centre or a general critical care unit outside a neuroscience centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOSE) questionnaire and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, 3-level version (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire at 6 months following TBI. RESULTS: The final Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN) study data set contained 3626 admissions After exclusions, 3210 patients with acute TBI were included. Overall follow-up rate at 6 months was 81%. Of 3210 patients, 101 (3.1%) had no GCS score recorded and 134 (4.2%) had a last pre-sedation GCS score of 15, resulting in 2975 patients for analysis. The most common causes of TBI were road traffic accidents (RTAs) (33%), falls (47%) and assault (12%). Patients were predominantly young (mean age 45 years overall) and male (76% overall). Six-month mortality was 22% for RTAs, 32% for falls and 17% for assault. Of survivors at 6 months with a known GOSE category, 44% had severe disability, 30% moderate disability and 26% made a good recovery. Overall, 61% of patients with known outcome had an unfavourable outcome (death or severe disability) at 6 months. Between 35% and 70% of survivors reported problems across the five domains of the EQ-5D-3L. Of the 10 risk models selected for validation, the best discrimination overall was from the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI Lab model (IMPACT) (c-index 0.779 for mortality, 0.713 for unfavourable outcome). The model was well calibrated for 6-month mortality but substantially underpredicted the risk of unfavourable outcome at 6 months. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between dedicated neurocritical care units and combined neuro/general critical care units. In lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis, dedicated neurocritical care units had higher mean lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at small additional mean costs with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £14,000 per QALY and incremental net monetary benefit (INB) of £17,000. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve suggested that the probability that dedicated compared with combined neurocritical care units are cost-effective is around 60%. There were substantial differences in case mix between the 'early' (within 18 hours of presentation) and 'no or late' (after 24 hours) transfer groups. After adjustment, the 'early' transfer group reported higher lifetime QALYs at an additional cost with an ICER of £11,000 and INB of £17,000. CONCLUSIONS: The risk models demonstrated sufficient statistical performance to support their use in research but fell below the level required to guide individual patient decision-making. The results suggest that management in a dedicated neurocritical care unit may be cost-effective compared with a combined neuro/general critical care unit (although there is considerable statistical uncertainty) and support current recommendations that all patients with severe TBI would benefit from transfer to a neurosciences centre, regardless of the need for surgery. We recommend further research to improve risk prediction models; consider alternative approaches for handling unobserved confounding; better understand long-term outcomes and alternative pathways of care; and explore equity of access to postcritical care support for patients following acute TBI.

15031,Incorporation of the experience of patients in the development of a patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) for carpal tunnel syndrome,"Aged; Carpal Tunnel Syndrome/surgery; Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods; Patient Satisfaction/statistics & numerical data; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome","BACKGROUND: Regularly, patients are not involved in development of evaluative tools. Investigators define outcomes according to their interests. These can be different with those of the patients. Therefore, it may be difficult for patients to choose between treatment options, because the outcomes' measurements may not reflect their problems in daily life. Most ideally, patients are involved from the beginning in the development of an outcome measurement tool. In this study, a new concept was demonstrated in which a questionnaire was developed in collaboration with patients to evaluate the quality of surgical care of a frequently encountered entity (carpal tunnel syndrome) that is meaningful for and understandable by patients. METHODS: Through a patient participatory research in an academic hospital, 50 consecutive patients who recently underwent surgical decompression of carpal tunnel syndrome were asked to optimize a questionnaire An existing questionnaire was sent to the patients with the request to grade the relevance of each question. They were also offered the possibility to add questions from their point of view. RESULTS: All questions were found relevant Finally, the questionnaire was modified by adding one question proposed by the patients. They wanted to include a question that would evaluate the effect of the treatment. Therefore, a question was introduced to evaluate the effect of the surgery on the symptoms and signs with a six-item Likert scale varying from severely worsened to free of signs and symptoms. Finally, the EQ-5D-5 L was added as a measure of quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The participation of patients is essential but until now not usual when a tool for evaluating the success of a treatment is developed. Information that is meaningful for patients but not obligate for researchers can easily be missed in the classical development of outcome measurement tools. This information will be crucial when future patients try to understand the findings of research in order to make an appropriate decision between eventual treatment options",10.1007/s00701-013-1708-y,0

It is unique from nociceptive pain and requires evaluation of the relevance and utility of common pain measures created for other painful conditions. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of a modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) for patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (BPI-DPN). Participants were patients with painful DPN (n = 255) enrolled in a DPN Burden of Illness survey referred through 17 outpatient settings (primary care physicians, endocrinologists, neurologists, and anesthesiologists). Patients completed the BPI-DPN and self-report measures of health-related quality of life, mood sleep, and health care use. Construct, criterion and discriminant validity, and internal consistency reliability were evaluated. Principal axis factoring with oblimin rotation revealed two interpretable factors (eigenvalues > 1.0), consistent with most published BPI validation studies: a severity scale comprising the four BPI Severity items and an interference scale comprising the seven Interference items, which satisfied criteria for interpretability and model fit. Cronbach's alpha was high (0.94) for both scales. Mean pain Severity was highly correlated with Bodily Pain from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12, version 2 (r(s) = 0.63, P < .001), the Pain/Discomfort item in the Euro-QoL (r(s) = 0.58, P < .001), and a verbal rating scale measure of pain severity (r(s) = 0.74, P < .001). Individual BPI-DPN Interference domains were moderately correlated (r(s)'s > 0.5, P < .001) with analogous measures, and the Sleep Interference item had a high, significant association with the three primary Medical Outcome Study-Sleep scale subscales (r(s)'s = 0.66-71, P < .001). Worst Pain and Interference ratings were significantly associated with hospital use and outpatient visits because of DPN These results replicate, in a pure peripheral neuropathic pain condition, the BPI psychometric characteristics documented in populations with nociceptive or mixed pain conditions. The BPI-DPN is a promising instrument in the evaluation of painful DPN",10.1016/j.jvn.2005.06.004,1

A major risk factor for falls is the use of fall-risk increasing drugs. The primary aim of the study is to compare the effect of a structured medication assessment including the withdrawal of fall-risk increasing drugs on the number of new falls versus 'care as usual' in older adults presenting at the Emergency Department after a fall. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial will be conducted in hospitals in the Netherlands. Persons aged ≥65 years who visit the Emergency Department due to a fall are invited to participate in this trial. All patients receive a full geriatric assessment at the research outpatient clinic. Patients are randomized between a structured medication assessment including withdrawal of fall-risk increasing drugs and 'care as usual'. A 3-monthly falls calendar is used for assessing the number of falls, fallers and associated injuries over a one-year follow-up period. Measurements will be at three, six, nine, and twelve months and include functional outcome, healthcare consumption, socio-demographic characteristics, and clinical information. After twelve months a second visit to the research outpatient clinic will be performed, and adherence to the new medication regimen in the intervention group will be measured. The primary outcome will be the incidence of new falls. Secondary outcome measurements are possible health effects of medication withdrawal, health-related quality of life (Short Form-12 and EuroQol-5D), costs, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat analysis DISCUSSION: The successful completion of this trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of withdrawal of fall-risk increasing drugs in older patients as a method for falls reduction. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR1593)",10.1186/1471-2318-11-48,0
